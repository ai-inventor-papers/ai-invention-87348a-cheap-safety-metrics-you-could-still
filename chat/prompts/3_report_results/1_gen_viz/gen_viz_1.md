## Task: `gen_viz_1` (terminal_claude_agent)

### [1] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-22 01:36:07 UTC

````


<pasted_content id="5f3c">
<system-prompt>
<research_methodology>
Create figures that belong in a top-venue paper.

- Every figure needs a clear takeaway visible at a glance.
- Choose chart types that match the data relationship (comparisons, trends, correlations, distributions).
- Include uncertainty (error bars, confidence intervals) when showing experimental results.
- Keep it clean — no clutter, clear labels with units, readable at print size.
</research_methodology>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<subagent-delegation>
Your own tokens are the scarcest and most expensive resource in this run. Your job is to decompose the work, delegate it, coordinate, decide, verify briefly, and synthesize. It is not to work through the pieces yourself.

Delegate by default (e.g. with the Task tool): anything beyond a trivial step goes to a subagent, even when it is one sequential task with nothing to split. Running a script, debugging a failure, reading a long output or log, searching the repo or the literature, drafting text: all of it is subagent work, and so is a loop of write code, run it, read the output, fix, rerun. The reason is context isolation, not only parallelism. Every stdout dump, traceback and dead end a subagent absorbs is one that never enters your context; only its conclusion comes back. Keep a step for yourself only when one obvious search-free action beats the handoff, such as a one-line edit or a single lookup.

- Pick the cheapest tier that can do the job:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Raise the tier only after a cheaper one has failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Split orthogonal pieces by file or artifact ownership up front, one subagent per piece, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Keep handoffs short: objective, exact scope, constraints, acceptance check, output format. Ask for findings back as text.
- Subagents report only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers, never narration or full logs.
- What stays with you: the decisions, a short sanity check on what came back (one bash command, one file read), and the integration. Do not redo a subagent's work.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
</subagent-delegation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_1`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_1/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_1/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_1/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision:

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.
</disposable_outputs>
</system-prompt>

<prompt>
<task>
Generate a publication-quality figure for a top-tier venue research paper that exactly follows the provided specification.

Use the aii-concept-fig-gen skill to generate the figure in the aspect ratio from the spec. ALWAYS pass `--model flash --style neurips` to EVERY concept_fig_gen.py call (this run uses the **flash** Gemini image tier). `--style neurips` appends the paper style — white background, sans-serif labels, no 3D or shadows or gradients — so the tool carries it on every call instead of you having to remember it in every prompt. Be as detailed as possible in your image generation prompt: include all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, preferred colors, and describe where each element should be positioned. Then END the prompt with a separate sentence listing the words that must appear, verbatim — "The boxes read Tokenizer, Transformer, Classifier." Naming them inside the layout sentence instead is what turns Encoder into `Enc:der`; every measured run that stated them as their own closing sentence spelled all of them correctly, and word length made no difference either way.

IMPORTANT — Two-phase workflow: explore cheaply at 1K, then finalize at 2K. Create a subfolder `fig_overview_all/` in your workspace for ALL attempts.

PHASE 1 — Explore at 1K (HARD LIMIT: 5 attempts):
- Generate at `--model flash --image-size 1K` (fast and cheap). Save attempts as `fig_overview_all/fig_overview_v0_it1.jpg`, `fig_overview_all/fig_overview_v0_it2.jpg`, … up to `_it5.jpg`.
- After EACH attempt, read the image back and verify it against the checklist below. If it has issues, regenerate with a corrected prompt.
- Do AT MOST 5 generations in this phase — stop early as soon as one is clean. Then pick the single best 1K attempt (the "chosen base").

PHASE 2 — Finalize at 2K (EXACTLY 2 upscale passes of the chosen base):
- Run EXACTLY TWO generations at `--model flash --image-size 2K`, each in edit mode passing the chosen base as the input image (`--edit` the chosen base .jpg). Instruct it to upscale and sharpen while preserving the exact layout, data values, labels, and composition — and to fix any remaining issues from the checklist.
- Save them as `fig_overview_all/fig_overview_v0_2k_1.jpg` and `fig_overview_all/fig_overview_v0_2k_2.jpg`.
- Read both back, verify both, and choose the better of the two as the final figure.
- IF THE GENERATOR REFUSES EDIT MODE — on a $0 run the free image provider has no
  edit endpoint at all, and the tool says so ("the free image variant cannot edit
  an existing image") before spending anything — then SKIP this phase entirely and
  deliver the best PHASE 1 attempt. Do NOT pass `--paid` to get around it: that puts
  paid image spend on a run chosen to be free, which is the single largest line item
  a "free" run has ever been billed.

DELIVERABLE:
- Copy the chosen final image to your workspace root as: fig_overview_v0.jpg — the
  chosen 2K upscale when phase 2 ran, and the chosen 1K attempt when it could not.
- The file `fig_overview_v0.jpg` is the deliverable — everything in `fig_overview_all/` is reference only.

Verification checklist (apply after EVERY generation in BOTH phases). Check for:
- Layout issues (e.g. text too close together, figure looks cluttered, elements crammed into corners)
- Overlapping or touching labels, legends, or annotations
- Cut-off or truncated text, axis labels, or titles
- Wrong or missing data values, bars, lines, or data points
- Incorrect axis ranges, tick marks, or scales
- Missing or misplaced legend entries
- Blurry text, unreadable font sizes, or poor contrast
- Wrong font family (MUST be sans-serif like Helvetica/Arial — reject any serif fonts like Times New Roman)
- MISSPELLED labels. Read every word in the image letter by letter against the word you asked for. This is the most common defect by a wide margin — `erooder` for Encoder, `routter` for Router, `conveged?` for converged? — and it is the one that survives a glance, because the shape of the word is right
- Invented text you never asked for. A prompt ending "no text of any kind" came back lettered with `Kat q` and fake axis ticks, so absence has to be checked too, not assumed
- A box, arrow or panel that is duplicated, missing, or pointing nowhere, even when every word in the image is spelled correctly

In Phase 1, if ANY issue is found — even minor — do another attempt (within the 5-attempt limit). Do NOT accept a figure with problems as the chosen base.

Change the prompt only when the prompt is what was wrong — a word you never specified, an element you forgot to name. For a defect the prompt already rules out, re-run it UNCHANGED: the same prompt sent twice gave a correct three-box chain once and four boxes with one label repeated the other time. Rewriting a prompt that was already right spends one of five attempts on a variable that was not the cause.

Title: Pipeline Overview
Caption: Overview of the cheap safety metric screening pipeline. Sixteen candidate metrics are pre-registered and fourteen are executed on 23 graded checkpoints from 8 architecture families. Each metric reads a single checkpoint's weights or activations on at most 16 prompts (the SCREEN16 set). Ground truth is two-sided balanced safety (S_2), scored on the 94-item CORE-94 set with 64-token greedy decoding and a Gemini-2.5-Flash stance judge. Six pre-registered selection rules filter candidates; one candidate (C12, twin d-prime) passes all six.
Image Generation Description: A horizontal flowchart diagram on a white background with three main stages connected by arrows. Stage 1 (left, blue box): 'Checkpoint Panel' showing '36 checkpoints, 8 families, 23 graded' with small model icons. Stage 2 (middle, split into two parallel tracks): Top track (green box): 'Ground Truth' with text 'CORE-94: 66 harmful + 28 XSTest-safe, 64-token greedy, Gemini-2.5-Flash judge' leading to 'S_2 = 0.5*(harm-refusal) + 0.5*(benign-compliance)'. Bottom track (orange box): '16 Candidate Metrics' with text 'C1-C16, SCREEN16 (16 prompts), single GPU, no generation' with a small list 'C1: harm gain, C2: self-ablation, ..., C12: twin d-prime, ..., C16: steering dose'. Stage 3 (right): 'Pre-Registered Screen' (purple box) showing '6 Rules: S1 incremental signal, S2 direction specificity, S3 pole control, S4 sign agreement, S5 efficiency, S6 beyond confounds'. An arrow from Stage 3 leads to a result box (dark blue, bold text): 'Survivor: C12 (rho=0.61)' with a smaller line 'C2 (rho=0.90) passes repaired rules only'. Use sans-serif font, clean lines, muted professional colors.
Aspect Ratio: 16:9
Summary: Conceptual overview of the screening pipeline from checkpoint panel through candidate metrics and selection rules to the sole survivor C12.

<critical_requirements>
1. Accurately represent ALL data values described above — include every number mentioned
2. Do NOT invent additional data points beyond what is described
3. Include clear axis labels only if the figure has axes (not for diagrams/flowcharts)
4. FONT: ALL text MUST use sans-serif font (Helvetica/Arial). NO serif fonts (Times New Roman). Always include "Sans-serif font throughout (Helvetica/Arial style, NOT Times New Roman)" in your image generation prompt. This is the #1 most common issue — check it first during verification
5. Publication camera-ready style: white backgrounds, properly formatted axes, no 3D effects/shadows/gradients. Follow aii-concept-fig-gen skill for image generation, prompting best practices, and figure type templates
6. TEXT SPACING: Ensure generous spacing between ALL text labels. Labels MUST NOT overlap or touch. Use large readable font sizes (minimum 12pt equivalent). If labels would overlap, stagger them vertically, use leader lines, or abbreviate. For multi-panel figures, add clear padding between panels
7. RESOLUTION: Explore at 1K (Phase 1), then finalize with two 2K upscale passes of the chosen base (Phase 2) — see the two-phase workflow above. Do NOT use 4K. For multi-panel or detail-heavy figures, use wider aspect ratios to give elements room
8. MANDATORY VERIFICATION: After EVERY generation attempt, read the image and check font first (sans-serif?), then layout, data accuracy, and readability. If anything is wrong, regenerate. Do NOT stop at the first attempt
</critical_requirements>


<evidence_check>
CRITICAL — this run's own final audit says its headline result is NOT supported:
the final review is marked blocking; the final hypothesis update recorded evidence_state='weak_or_null'. The figure specification above was written from a paper draft
that may therefore quote numbers no run ever produced.

Before you plot ANY number, find the artifact output file it is supposed to come from
and read the value there. Plot only values you have read back from an artifact output
file. If a value in the specification above is not in any results file — or the results
file holds far fewer examples, methods or conditions than the specification implies —
do NOT invent it and do NOT carry it over: draw only the series the data actually
supports, and say what the figure covers in its caption.

A figure whose bars disagree with the run's own output files is worse than a missing
figure, because nothing downstream can detect it.

qwen3 on huggingface has base model also official safety finetuned version and there is a community finetuned uncensored model called abliterated. take these models and do a mech interp analysis of how they differ in activation. also find some patterns in internal computation on safety prompts. and possibly create a new metric for safety. so that for any random model on huggingface you would not need to run the full benchmarks, but only this metric on 0- to few prompts and get a safety evaluation

i want cheap safety metrics that work on a single model. no parent, no reference model, no
attested base to diff against - assume i found some random model on huggingface and i have
nothing else. reads weights or activations. generation allowed but minimal, a few prompts at
most. seconds to a couple of minutes per model, not a benchmark run.

step 1 - explore. take one lineage: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base, Qwen/Qwen3-4B, Qwen/Qwen3-4B-SafeRL (the
official safety RL model, not the instruct one), and an abliterated Qwen3-4B. instruct, saferl
and abliterated share a chat template so they are directly comparable, base uses a different
format so keep it separate. poke around open ended, look at weights and activations, see what
actually differs between the four.

step 2 - design 50 metrics. informed by what you found in step 1, but also by the literature -
safety papers and mech interp papers in general, not only safety ones. include a few black-box
metrics too, things that only read logits or output text, like the logit-gap margin, so we have
a comparison point for whether looking inside the model actually buys anything.

step 3 - test all 50 much wider. other lineages, pairs and triplets where a safety-tuned or
abliterated sibling exists, and standalone models where none does. for each metric: does it
separate safe vs normal vs abliterated. hold out a set of models that no metric is tuned on,
because picking the best of 50 on the models you designed them on is cheating.

step 4 - ground truth. pull real benchmark numbers from official sources, model cards, papers,
leaderboards, not just your own judge. safety is not only refusal - try to cover other aspects
too, see TrustLLM and AIR-Bench for what that means. if that turns out to be too much, then two
separate refusal rates is acceptable as a fallback: refusal on harmful prompts, and refusal on
harmless prompts that only look dangerous (xstest style). either way a model that refuses
everything must lose, not win. also pull capability benchmarks, gsm8k, mmlu, arena-hard, to
see whether safety trades off against performance. do not use Qwen3Guard as a judge for SafeRL,
it was SafeRL's training reward.

step 5 - take the 10 best metrics and correlation-test them against those benchmark numbers.
report the resampling unit and both aggregation units. a metric that only works within one
architecture family is a negative result, say so.

bonus - if a metric works really well, mech interp analysis of why. what is it reading, which
layers and components carry it, what breaks it.

bonus bonus - instead of a static formula, train a small metamodel on activations that predicts
the safety benchmark scores. if it beats the formulas, explain what in the model's internal
computation it is picking up, and why that signal exists.

hardware: each experiment runs on a worker with one 16 GB VRAM GPU. load the 4B models in bf16 with transformers so hidden states and weights are readable. do not switch to llama.cpp or GGUF, that hides the activations this study is about.


invariant: at least 3 of the metrics you ship must read hidden states or weights of a single model. logit-only and teacher-forced readouts are baselines, at most 2 of them.

Run directory: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/ (search its experiment/eval output files: results JSON, full_data_out, method_out, eval_out etc., especially iteration 5 GPU tier and eval outputs, and the paper draft in 4_gen_paper_repo).

For each claim below, find the artifact OUTPUT file (not a plan/prompt) that holds the value and report: VERIFIED (path + exact value) / DIFFERENT (actual value + path) / NOT FOUND.
1. Checkpoint panel: 36 checkpoints total; 8 architecture families; 23 graded checkpoints (have ground truth S_2).
2. 16 candidate metrics pre-registered (C1-C16); 14 executed.

Generate a concept figure using the aii-concept-fig-gen skill (invoke the Skill tool with skill "aii-concept-fig-gen" first to learn the concept_fig_gen.py CLI). Workspace (ALL writes must go here): /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_2_gen_viz/gen_viz_1

EVERY concept_fig_gen.py call MUST pass `--model flash --style neurips`. Aspect ratio 16:9. Do NOT pass --paid ever.

FIGURE (all numbers verified from run artifacts; use exactly these):
Horizontal left-to-right flowchart, white background, sans-serif (Helvetica/Arial, NOT Times New Roman), flat, no shadows/gradients/3D, muted professional colors, generous spacing.
- Stage 1 (left, blue box) title "Checkpoint Panel"; lines "36 checkpoints", "8 families", "23 graded"; small simple model icons.
- Stage 2 (middle, two parallel tracks, each fed by an arrow from Stage 1):
  - Top track (green box) "Ground Truth": "CORE-94: 66 harmful + 28 XSTest-safe", "64-token greedy", "Gemini-2.5-Flash judge", with an arrow to a sub-box "S_2 = 0.5 × harm-refusal + 0.5 × benign-compliance".
  - Bottom track (orange box) "16 Candidate Metrics": "C1–C16, 14 executed", "SCREEN16 (16 prompts)", "single GPU, no generation", small list: "C1: harm-to-refusal gain", "C2: self-ablation", "C12: twin d-prime", "C16: steering dose".
- Stage 3 (right, purple box) "Pre-Registered Screen" — "6 Rules": "S1 incremental signal", "S2 direction specificity", "S3 pole control", "S4 sign agreement", "S5 efficiency", "S6 beyond confounds". Both tracks feed arrows into it.
- Arrow from Stage 3 to result box (dark blue fill, white bold text): "Survivor: C12 (rho = 0.61)" and smaller line "C2 (rho = 0.90) passes repaired rules only". Optionally a tiny line "C12 ties logit-gap baseline" only if it doesn't crowd.
Write the prompt in full detail with positions and colors, and END with a separate sentence listing verbatim all words that must appear.

WORKFLOW (strict):
PHASE 1: generate at `--image-size 1K`, save as fig_overview_all/fig_overview_v0_it1.jpg ... max _it5.jpg. After EACH, Read the image and check: sans-serif font, every word spelled letter-by-letter correctly (esp. "Gemini-2.5-Flash", "XSTest", "SCREEN16", "d-prime", "confounds", "specificity"), all numbers correct, no invented text, no duplicated/missing boxes or dangling arrows, no overlap/cut-off text. Stop early at a clean one. If the defect is one the prompt already rules out, re-run the same prompt unchanged; change the prompt only if it was the cause. Pick the best as chosen base.
PHASE 2: EXACTLY two `--image-size 2K` edit-mode runs (`--edit <chosen base>`) instructing: upscale and sharpen, preserve exact layout, values, labels; fix any remaining issues. Save fig_overview_all/fig_overview_v0_2k_1.jpg and _2k_2.jpg. Read both, pick the better. If the tool refuses edit mode (free variant cannot edit), skip Phase 2 and use the best 1K.
Copy final to workspace root: fig_overview_v0.jpg.

Also write in the workspace: README.md (what was done, layout, how to rerun with exact commands, "Restoring removed files" section — say none if nothing deleted) and .aii/manifest.yaml (`entries: []` unless a >10MB binary or cache dir exists; images are small, keep them if listed).

Report back (text, <250 words): number of attempts, which base chosen and why, which 2K chosen, defects seen in each attempt, any remaining imperfections in the final image, exact final text as rendered.
```

Generate images via OpenRouter's dedicated images API (`/api/v1/images`) through the ability server, on the two Gemini "Nano Banana" tiers. The `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` lives on the ability server — this skill routes requests through `call_server()`.

## Setup

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-concept-fig-gen"
G="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/concept_fig_gen.py"
PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

## Generate Image

```bash
$PY $G --prompt "prompt describing the image" --output output.jpg --aspect-ratio 16:9
```

## Free vs paid — check before you generate

Two billing paths. **You do not normally choose**: the run's backend already
set the default, and the flags below only override it.

| Path | Cost | Editing |
|---|---|---|
| paid (default) | ~$0.067/image @1K | yes |
| `--free` | $0 | no |

The paid path is OpenRouter's `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` (Nano Banana
2); `--free` is Cloudflare Workers AI (FLUX / SDXL), falling back to Hugging
Face `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers` (SD3).

`--free` serves inside Cloudflare's 10,000-neuron **daily** free allocation.
Gemini has no free image tier at all, so this is the only genuinely $0 route.

**`flash` is not one price.** ~$0.067/image at 1K but ~$0.101 at 2K, measured
live at $0.1017 for a 2K edit. It matters because the figure step deliberately
uses both: it explores at 1K and then makes exactly TWO 2K passes per figure,
so those two passes alone cost ~$0.20 a figure rather than the ~$0.134 the 1K
number implies. `pro` is flat at ~$0.134 across 1K and 2K, so it is only twice
the price of flash at 1K and about a third more at 2K.

The paid path has two quality tiers, selected with `--model` (orthogonal to
`--free`/`--paid`): the default `flash` (Nano Banana 2, ~$0.067/image @1K) and
`pro` (`gemini-3-pro-image-preview` / Nano Banana Pro, ~$0.134/image @1K-2K —
higher fidelity for hero/cover figures). **You do not normally choose this
either**: the pipeline sets it from the run's `gen_paper_repo.gen_viz.image_model`
config, and the Max/Ultra presets pick `pro`. A `pro` call that exhausts its
retries falls back to `flash`, and every charge the provider reports is
recorded — including one on a response that came back priced and carrying no
image, which is a refusal (quota, moderation) rather than a blank a retry
fills in. Such a response is not asked for again at the same price, and the
figure's failure still names what the body said.

- **On a free-tier run the default is already `--free`** (the backend exports
  `AII_FREE_TOOLS=1`). Do not pass `--paid` there: six figures on the paid
  path cost $0.81, which was 78% of a measured "free" run's entire bill.
- Pass `--paid` only when you must EDIT an existing image, which the free
  provider cannot do — it takes a prompt with no image input.
- The free path has TWO providers and walks between them. Cloudflare's
  10,000-neuron daily allocation is shared with the free LLM pool, so a busy day
  spends it; the call then fails over to Hugging Face automatically. You do not
  need to do anything for this.
- If BOTH are down the call fails. Do not silently fall back to paid on a free
  run: report it and continue without the figure.

### Free costs you the labels, not just the fidelity

The returned JSON's `model` field says which of the three served the image, and
it is worth reading: they are tiers apart on the thing concept figures are
mostly made of — words in boxes. Same prompt, same day, measured live:

| Model that served it | Diagram | Labels came out as |
|---|---|---|
| paid `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` | right | all three correct |
| CF `flux-1-schnell` | right | `Enc:der`, `conveged?` |
| HF SD3 medium | wrong | `erooder`, `routter` |

Three paid runs, three clean figures — every word right, and the flow chart
came back with the NO branch actually looping back, which neither free model
managed once. SD3 went the other way and put text in a figure that asked for
none: a prompt ending "no text of any kind" came back with `Kat q` and
`Wet ker wee Bir Sauh` lettered across it, in red and green as its two main
colours under `--style neurips`. Treat an HF-served image as a draft to check
hard, not a figure to ship.

That is where the $0.067 goes, so spend the verification effort to match: on a
free run read every word in the image letter by letter, and on a paid one look
first for the things a good speller still gets wrong — a stage you do not have,
an arrow the wrong way round.

None of it is checked automatically. `success: true` means a valid JPEG of the
right size arrived — nothing reads the words in it.

## Edit Image

```bash
$PY $G --edit input.jpg --prompt "Make the background blue" --output edited.jpg
```

**Parameters:**
- `--prompt` / `-p` (required) — image description or edit instruction
- `--output` / `-o` (default: `./generated_image.jpg`) — output file path (always saved as `.jpg`; suffix is forced)
- `--edit` — path to source image for editing (omit for generation)
- `--aspect-ratio` (default: `16:9`) — valid: `1:1`, `2:3`, `3:2`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `9:16`, `16:9`, `21:9`
- `--image-size` (default: `1K`) — resolution: `1K`, `2K`, `4K`
- `--model` (default: `flash`) — paid Gemini tier: `flash` (Nano Banana 2, ~$0.067/img) or `pro` (Nano Banana Pro, ~$0.134/img @1K-2K). Normally set by the pipeline from `gen_paper_repo.gen_viz.image_model` (Max/Ultra presets pick `pro`); ignored on `--free`.
- `--style neurips` — appends NeurIPS academic style guidance
- `--negative-prompt` — things to exclude from the image
- `--system` — system-level style instruction
- `--timeout` (default: `180`) — the WHOLE call's deadline, and therefore the
  retry budget. Each attempt gets the lesser of 180 s and whatever is left, and
  the loop will not start one it cannot finish: with 180 s and fast failures
  (a connection error, a 5xx) all six paid attempts run, while on slow
  responses it stops and says how much budget was left rather than being cut
  off mid-request. Raise it if you want the full budget under slow responses —
  six attempts of 180 s would need 1092 s.

## Parallel Batch Generation

Use GNU `parallel` for multiple images:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-concept-fig-gen"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
export G="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/concept_fig_gen.py"
parallel -j 5 -k --group --will-cite 'eval {}' ::: \
  "\$PY \$G -p \"prompt 1\" -o output_1.jpg --aspect-ratio 21:9" \
  "\$PY \$G -p \"prompt 2\" -o output_2.jpg --aspect-ratio 16:9" \
  "\$PY \$G -p \"prompt 3\" -o output_3.jpg --aspect-ratio 1:1"
```

## Preview

Do **NOT** open generated images in a GUI viewer (`loupe`, `xdg-open`, `eog`,
etc.). This skill is for automated / headless generation (e.g. pipeline figure
steps), and popping image windows clutters the user's desktop. Inspect images
programmatically if needed (read the file, check the returned JSON), not by
opening a viewer.

For interactive, human-curated review of multiple figure variants — where the
user wants to arrow-navigate batches in `loupe` — use the
`amg-iter-image-gen-human` skill instead; loupe-driven review is its job, not
this one's.

## Features

- **Model**: default `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` (Nano Banana 2, `--model flash`); `--model pro` selects `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (Nano Banana Pro), which falls back to flash if it exhausts its retries
- **Auth**: API key on ability server (routed via `call_server()`)
- **Retries**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff, then fallback model — as far as `--timeout` allows, since it is the deadline for the whole call
- **Edit mode**: Edit existing images with text instructions
- **Parallel**: GNU `parallel` with `-j 5` for batch generation
- **Headless**: never auto-opens a viewer (use `amg-iter-image-gen-human` for human review)

## Prompting Tips

- Name every element and where it sits — boxes, arrows, groupings, labels.
  The model places what you describe and invents what you leave out
- **Put the labels in their own closing sentence**, not inline in the sentence
  that describes the layout. "…three boxes joined by arrows. The boxes read
  Tokenizer, Transformer, Classifier." rendered all three words correctly;
  "…three labelled boxes left to right, Encoder, Router, Decoder, joined by
  arrows…" rendered `Enc:der`. Four out of four runs that stated the labels
  as a separate final sentence spelled every one of them right, including the
  same words the inline phrasing had corrupted. Word length was not the
  driver — `Transformer` and `Classifier` both came out clean
- Specify colors, fonts, layout, and what to exclude
- Use `--style neurips` for academic papers. It also pins the figure to the
  same colours every DATA figure in the paper uses — seaborn's `colorblind`
  — and tells the model not to let red-versus-green be the only difference
  between two elements, which is the one pairing that carries no meaning for
  about 8% of male readers
- Any number that DOES appear — a throughput on an arrow, a stage count —
  has to be stated explicitly, and read back off the image to check it
  survived. If the figure is mostly numbers, it is a data figure: stop and
  use `aii-data-fig-gen`, which renders them instead of approximating them
- 1K resolution is default and most reliable

## Figure type templates

An image model draws what you name and invents what you leave out, so the
prompt for each kind of concept figure has a different set of things it
cannot omit. Each entry below names the kind, its usual aspect ratio and those
things; start from the one that matches and add the specifics.

- **Architecture / pipeline diagram** (`21:9`) — every stage in order, left to
  right; what flows along each arrow and which way it points; which stages are
  yours vs. baseline or off-the-shelf; where the boundary of the system sits.
- **Flow chart** (`21:9` or `16:9`) — each decision point and both of its
  outcomes; where a branch rejoins; the start and the terminal states; that
  arrows are labelled, not bare.
- **Side-by-side comparison** (`16:9`) — what the two panels are, in which
  order; that both use the SAME visual vocabulary so only the difference
  differs; a caption strip or heading per panel.
- **Conceptual artwork / cover** (`1:1`, `16:9`) — the single idea in one
  sentence; the metaphor and what maps to what; that no text appears unless you
  asked for it, since invented labels are the usual failure.

Two things every entry shares: state the sans-serif requirement (`--style
neurips` does it for you), and read the image back to check that nothing was
invented — a stage that is not in your pipeline, an arrow that runs the wrong
way, a label you never wrote.

Reading it back is not optional, and re-running is a real fix. The same prompt
sent twice gave a correct three-box chain once and, the other time, four boxes
with `Encoder` in two of them and an arrow pointing at nothing — identical
text, different diagram. So a structure you cannot check by looking is a
structure you do not have; when it comes back wrong, generate it again rather
than editing the prompt, because the prompt was not what failed.

## Aspect Ratios

Pick by shape, not by venue. `--help` lists all ten; these are the ones a
paper figure normally wants.

| Ratio | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| `21:9` | Ultra-wide — pipelines, architecture, the hero figure |
| `16:9` | Wide — side-by-side comparisons, multi-panel concepts |
| `4:3`, `3:2`, `5:4` | Standard — one diagram with room around it |
| `1:1` | Square — a symmetric diagram, a cover image |
| `9:16`, `3:4`, `2:3`, `4:5` | Vertical — a stacked flow or poster |

**If the ability server is not running**, nothing needs doing: the CLI already
falls back to running the same function in-process, so `concept_fig_gen.py`
works standalone. Verified — with no server reachable it still resolves the
free/paid path and reports its own errors ("OPENROUTER_API_KEY not set")
rather than a connection failure.

What it needs is the deps. If the import fails, install them INTO THE VENV
`$PY` names above — creating a `.venv` in whatever directory you happen to be
standing in leaves `$PY` pointing at the same broken interpreter:
```bash
CLIENT_VENV="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv"
uv venv "$CLIENT_VENV" --python=3.12          # only if it is not there yet
uv pip install --python="$CLIENT_VENV/bin/python" \
  -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
