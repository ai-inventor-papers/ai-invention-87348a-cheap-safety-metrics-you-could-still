**MINIMAL CHANGES — PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL CODE**

The goal is to make the artifact's code READABLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, and RUNNABLE in a short time
to someone reviewing the research, with the option to easily scale parameters back to original
values for a full run (which can take much longer). Think of this as annotating and reformatting,
not refactoring.

**DO:**
- Split the original script into logical notebook cells (imports, setup, processing, results)
- Add markdown cells BETWEEN code cells explaining what each section does and why
- Add inline comments where the logic is non-obvious
- Add a visualization/summary cell at the end showing key outputs
- Fix hardcoded file paths to use the GitHub data loading pattern

**DO NOT:**
- Rewrite functions or change algorithms
- Rename variables or restructure logic
- Add error handling, type hints, or "improvements" that weren't in the original
- Simplify or "clean up" the original code
- Remove any original comments or logic
- Change the computational approach

The reader should recognize the original script when looking at the notebook — it's the
same code, just split into cells with explanatory markdown between sections.
</conversion_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<subagent-delegation>
Your own tokens are the scarcest and most expensive resource in this run. Your job is to decompose the work, delegate it, coordinate, decide, verify briefly, and synthesize. It is not to work through the pieces yourself.

Delegate by default (e.g. with the Task tool): anything beyond a trivial step goes to a subagent, even when it is one sequential task with nothing to split. Running a script, debugging a failure, reading a long output or log, searching the repo or the literature, drafting text: all of it is subagent work, and so is a loop of write code, run it, read the output, fix, rerun. The reason is context isolation, not only parallelism. Every stdout dump, traceback and dead end a subagent absorbs is one that never enters your context; only its conclusion comes back. Keep a step for yourself only when one obvious search-free action beats the handoff, such as a one-line edit or a single lookup.

- Pick the cheapest tier that can do the job:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Raise the tier only after a cheaper one has failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Split orthogonal pieces by file or artifact ownership up front, one subagent per piece, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Keep handoffs short: objective, exact scope, constraints, acceptance check, output format. Ask for findings back as text.
- Subagents report only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers, never narration or full logs.
- What stays with you: the decisions, a short sanity check on what came back (one bash command, one file read), and the integration. Do not redo a subagent's work.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
</subagent-delegation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_4/art_YKxMUIEOomlX`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_4/art_YKxMUIEOomlX/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_4/art_YKxMUIEOomlX/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_4/art_YKxMUIEOomlX/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
A SHARED CACHE ALREADY EXISTS FOR THIS RUN: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/.shared_cache`
`HF_HOME`, `HF_HUB_CACHE`, `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`, `HF_DATASETS_CACHE`,
`TORCH_HOME`, `PIP_CACHE_DIR` and `UV_CACHE_DIR` are ALREADY set to point
there. Every step and every iteration of this run shares it, so a model or
dataset an earlier experiment downloaded is already on disk for you.

DO NOT override those variables. In particular do NOT write the common
pattern `os.environ["HF_HOME"] = <workspace>/hf_cache` — `HF_HOME` and
`TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` are read differently by `huggingface_hub` (one has
`/hub` appended, the other does not), so pointing both at one directory
stores every weight TWICE. That mistake cost one run 25 GB of identical
blobs. If you must set them, use the values above verbatim.

YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision:

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

title: Testing inside-the-model safety checks on 36 chat models
summary: |-
  LIVE (intervention) tier of the iter-4 16-candidate cheap-safety screen, run on an NVIDIA L4 GPU. This was session 4, after three pod restarts; sessions 1-3 were CPU-only and their 12 rows are kept as a cross-hardware check. Every non-sealed chat checkpoint of the iter-3 panel (35) plus Qwen3-4B-Base (base stratum) was measured one model at a time on the 16 frozen SCREEN16 prompts (8 harmful/benign-twin pairs, seed 20260921), in bf16 under a 9.3 GB VRAM cap. Candidates: C1 finite-difference harm->refusal gain, C2 two-sided self-ablation, C3 twin-patching flip, C7 attention on twin-differing tokens, C8 grad x input share, C9 template-site share (Leong replication), C11 8-token commitment, C16 steering slope (comparator). Logit-only bars: first-token logit gap and refusal-token mass. Each read has a direction null (20 anisotropy-matched random directions), a k=8 variant, both wrapped poles and oracle rows; a constant-offset control ran on 7 models. PREREG.json (S1-S6) was hashed before scoring, and analyze_live.py applies the rules mechanically.

  RESULTS (graded n=23, 8 families, 11 lineages, 2 blanket refusers; MDE_rho=0.531). NO internal candidate passes all of S1-S6. C2 is the strongest single-model read: rho=0.900 [0.793,0.971] with the BALANCED target, against 0.772 [0.441,0.902] for the logit gap. It reaches 0.881 at family level and 0.884 on the PRODUCT target. Its partial rho given the logit gap and log size is 0.746 (one-sided 5% lineage-bootstrap bound 0.440), so it passes S1. It is significant within all 3 families with >=3 graded checkpoints: Qwen2.5 1.00, Qwen3 0.95 and TinyLlama 1.00, where the logit gap has 0.00. C2 fails S2(b): it exceeds its null p95 on 7/23 models (7/11 upper-half vs 0/12 lower-half). It also fails S3: an always-refuse wrapper does not lower it on every honest model (15/24 checks). C1 passes S1 (partial 0.491, bound 0.242) but fails S2/S3; it orders the Qwen3-4B quartet exactly (SafeRL > instruct > heretic > mlabonne-abliterated). C3, C7, C8 and C9 carry no signal (|rho|<=0.2). C11 and C16 'work within one family only: NEGATIVE'. S5 is met: the whole live screen of a 4B model takes ~16 s after load on the L4.

  EXPLORATORY (post hoc, never in S1-S6).
  (i) Against the model's own judged behaviour on the same 16 prompts (rho 0.931), C2 adds partial rho 0.315 (bound -0.122).
  (ii) The C2 depth sweep reproduces the production value exactly and peaks at the pre-registered 50% band (0.90; 0.45->0.62, 0.55->0.83), so the read is band-sensitive.
  (iii) A variance-matched direction null (exact reproduction of the production null) raises C2's exceed count from 7/23 to 11/23. S2(b) still fails (48% < 60%).
  (iv) CPU vs GPU re-measurement of 12 models: Spearman 1.00 for C1, C7 and the logit gap, 0.92 for C2. C11 moves by a median 41% because greedy replies diverge; C9 moves 15% because one pair crosses the informativeness gate.

  ROSI side arm (128 tokens, gemini judge, CPU fp32): the x4 reversal shrinks and is not significant under the balanced target (dD2 -0.070 [-0.172,0.031]). It persists under the product target (-0.177 [-0.339,-0.020]). The hidden-direction control is null.

<github_repo>
Repo URL: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-87348a-cheap-safety-metrics-you-could-still
Raw data URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-87348a-cheap-safety-metrics-you-could-still/main/round-4/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json

URLs won't work yet — files pushed to GitHub AFTER notebook creation.
Use local fallback pattern so notebook works locally (now) and in Colab (after deployment).
</github_repo>

<data_file_sizes>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_file_sizes>

<install_dependencies_pattern>
Follow the aii-colab skill exactly. It has the install cell pattern, pre-installed package list, numpy 2.0 compat shims, and all Colab-specific rules.
</install_dependencies_pattern>

<data_loading_pattern>
`mini_demo_data.json` = curated subset for the demo.
Use this pattern for Colab compatibility (GitHub URL with local fallback):
```python
GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-87348a-cheap-safety-metrics-you-could-still/main/round-4/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json"
import json
from pathlib import Path

def load_data():
    try:
        import urllib.request
        with urllib.request.urlopen(GITHUB_DATA_URL) as response:
            return json.loads(response.read().decode())
    except Exception: pass
    local = Path("mini_demo_data.json")
    if local.exists(): return json.loads(local.read_text())
    raise FileNotFoundError("Could not load mini_demo_data.json")
```
</data_loading_pattern>

<notebook_structure>
--- Setup ---
Cell 1 (markdown): Title, description, what this artifact does.
Cell 2 (code): Install dependencies — follow the aii-colab skill's install cell pattern exactly. Fill in all packages imported by the artifact's code.
Cell 3 (code): Imports — copy original import block as-is, plus any additional imports needed for the notebook (e.g. matplotlib for visualization).
Cell 4 (code): Data loading helper — use the <data_loading_pattern> above.
Cell 5 (code): `data = load_data()`

--- Config ---
Config cell (code): Define ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, etc.) as variables at the top of this cell. Start with the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output at all (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array size). These get gradually increased during testing — see TODOs.

--- Processing ---
Remaining cells: One code cell per logical section of the original script. Add a markdown cell BEFORE each code cell. Copy code as closely as possible, with these changes:
  1. Replace file paths to use the loaded `data` variable.
  2. Use the config variables from the config cell (NOT hardcoded values).
  3. Minimal fixes are allowed if something doesn't work in notebook context (e.g. adjusting paths, removing CLI args, fixing imports), but keep changes to the absolute minimum.

--- Results ---
Visualization cell (code): Print key results in a readable table, plot numeric data with matplotlib if appropriate.
</notebook_structure>

<priority>
WORKING > OPTIMIZED. A small-scale demo that runs correctly is the goal. Once the notebook passes with minimum config values, scale up only if time permits — do NOT spend multiple retries chasing larger parameters. If a working version exists, finish and move on.
</priority>

<max_notebook_total_runtime>600s (10 min)</max_notebook_total_runtime>

<test_environment>
To test-run the notebook in a clean environment (simulating Colab), create a disposable `.nb_env` in your workspace:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```
The timeout is set to <max_notebook_total_runtime>. The entire notebook must finish within this time.

What happens: the .venv starts empty (just jupyter). When the notebook's install cell runs, `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules, so ALL packages get installed — non-Colab packages unconditionally, and Colab packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) at Colab's exact versions via the guard block. The result mirrors Colab's environment as closely as possible. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.
</test_environment>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.


<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-colab, aii-long-running-tasks.
TODO 2. Read demo file and relevant preview_* files (preview only). Understand script structure: imports, setup, processing, output. Identify ALL tunable parameters (iterations, epochs, n_samples, hidden_size, batch_size, etc.) — these go in the config cell.
TODO 3. Create `mini_demo_data.json`: curated subset from at most ONE dataset (no more than 100 diverse examples). CRITICAL: do NOT read/grep full output file — may crash. Use `head -c 5000` or stream first entries with Python to pick examples.
TODO 4. Create `code_demo.ipynb` via NotebookEdit following <notebook_structure>. Set ALL config parameters to ABSOLUTE MINIMUM values — the smallest that produce any output (e.g. 1 iteration, 2 samples, smallest array sizes). Test-run using <test_environment>. Fix all errors until it passes.
TODO 5. GRADUALLY SCALE (but don't overdo it): increase config params step by step (e.g. ~2x each round). After each increase: test-run, record runtime, fix errors. STOP SCALING as soon as results look meaningful — a working small-scale demo beats a failed large-scale one. If full original params fit within <max_notebook_total_runtime> (10% margin), use them. Otherwise keep whatever works and comment out the true original values. Do NOT spend more than 2-3 scaling rounds.
TODO 6. Verify: (1) code_demo.ipynb contains GITHUB_DATA_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-87348a-cheap-safety-metrics-you-could-still/main/round-4/experiment-1/demo/mini_demo_data.json" exactly, (2) mini_demo_data.json exists, (3) uses GitHub URL pattern not just open('mini_demo_data.json').
</todos>

qwen3 on huggingface has base model also official safety finetuned version and there is a commun

<pasted_content id="b907">
ity finetuned uncensored model called abliterated. take these models and do a mech interp analysis of how they differ in activation. also find some patterns in internal computation on safety prompts. and possibly create a new metric for safety. so that for any random model on huggingface you would not need to run the full benchmarks, but only this metric on 0- to few prompts and get a safety evaluation

i want cheap safety metrics that work on a single model. no parent, no reference model, no
attested base to diff against - assume i found some random model on huggingface and i have
nothing else. reads weights or activations. generation allowed but minimal, a few prompts at
most. seconds to a couple of minutes per model, not a benchmark run.

step 1 - explore. take one lineage: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base, Qwen/Qwen3-4B, Qwen/Qwen3-4B-SafeRL (the
official safety RL model, not the instruct one), and an abliterated Qwen3-4B. instruct, saferl
and abliterated share a chat template so they are directly comparable, base uses a different
format so keep it separate. poke around open ended, look at weights and activations, see what
actually differs between the four.

step 2 - design 50 metrics. informed by what you found in step 1, but also by the literature -
safety papers and mech interp papers in general, not only safety ones. include a few black-box
metrics too, things that only read logits or output text, like the logit-gap margin, so we have
a comparison point for whether looking inside the model actually buys anything.

step 3 - test all 50 much wider. other lineages, pairs and triplets where a safety-tuned or
abliterated sibling exists, and standalone models where none does. for each metric: does it
separate safe vs normal vs abliterated. hold out a set of models that no metric is tuned on,
because picking the best of 50 on the models you designed them on is cheating.

step 4 - ground truth. pull real benchmark numbers from official sources, model cards, papers,
leaderboards, not just your own judge. safety is not only refusal - try to cover other aspects
too, see TrustLLM and AIR-Bench for what that means. if that turns out to be too much, then two
separate refusal rates is acceptable as a fallback: refusal on harmful prompts, and refusal on
harmless prompts that only look dangerous (xstest style). either way a model that refuses
everything must lose, not win. also pull capability benchmarks, gsm8k, mmlu, arena-hard, to
see whether safety trades off against performance. do not use Qwen3Guard as a judge for SafeRL,
it was SafeRL's training reward.

step 5 - take the 10 best metrics and correlation-test them against those benchmark numbers.
report the resampling unit and both aggregation units. a metric that only works within one
architecture family is a negative result, say so.

bonus - if a metric works really well, mech interp analysis of why. what is it reading, which
layers and components carry it, what breaks it.

bonus bonus - instead of a static formula, train a small metamodel on activations that predicts
the safety benchmark scores. if it beats the formulas, explain what in the model's internal
computation it is picking up, and why that signal exists.

hardware: each experiment runs on a worker with one 16 GB VRAM GPU. load the 4B models in bf16 with transformers so hidden states and weights are readable. do not switch to llama.cpp or GGUF, that hides the activations this study is about.


invariant: at least 3 of the metrics you ship must read hidden states or weights of a single model. logit-only and teacher-forced readouts are baselines, at most 2 of them.

- **OS**: Linux 6.6.105+ x86_64, glibc 2.35

## Critical Rule: Do NOT pip install pre-installed packages ON COLAB

Colab's core scientific packages have **compiled C extensions** linked against each other at specific ABI versions. Installing ANY different version (even a minor bump) partially overwrites files while the loaded `.so` extensions stay in memory, causing:

- `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed` (numpy 1.x vs 2.x ABI)
- `ImportError: cannot import name '_center'` (numpy 2.0 vs 2.2 ABI)
- Silent corruption of scipy/sklearn/pandas internals

**On Colab: do NOT install these packages. Use Colab's versions.**
**Locally: MUST install these packages at Colab's exact versions** to match the Colab environment.

## Pre-installed Core Packages

These are pre-installed on Colab. On Colab: skip them. Locally: install at these exact versions.

## Install Cell Pattern

The install cell must work on BOTH Colab and local Jupyter. Use this conditional pattern:

```python
import subprocess, sys
def _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])

# Packages NOT pre-installed on Colab (always install everywhere)
_pip('some-rare-pkg==1.2.3')

# Core packages (pre-installed on Colab, install locally to match Colab env)
if 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:
    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'scipy==1.16.3', 'matplotlib==3.10.0')
```

**How this works:**
- On **Colab**: `google.colab` is in `sys.modules` → skips core packages (uses Colab's pre-installed ones) → only installs non-Colab packages
- **Locally**: `google.colab` is NOT in `sys.modules` → installs core packages at Colab's exact versions → local .venv matches Colab's environment as closely as possible

Rules:
- CRITICAL: On Colab, pip installing ANY version of numpy/pandas/sklearn/scipy/matplotlib (even the same version) CORRUPTS the pre-loaded C extensions. These MUST be behind the `google.colab` guard.
- Check the pre-installed package list above. If a package is on that list, put it in the `google.colab` guard block. If not, install it unconditionally.
- For the local (non-Colab) install, use the EXACT versions from the list above so the local environment matches Colab.
- Do NOT use `--force-reinstall` — corrupts Colab system packages.
- Do NOT use `%pip` or `!pip` — use the `_pip()` helper for proper conditional control.
- `%%capture` hides install noise — only add AFTER testing is done.
- If a package requires a newer numpy/scipy than Colab has, that package is INCOMPATIBLE with Colab — find an older version or alternative.

### Example

Code imports: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, `imodels`, `dit`, `rich`

```python
import subprocess, sys
def _pip(*a): subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-q', *a])

# imodels, dit — NOT on Colab, always install
_pip('imodels==2.0.4')
_pip('--no-deps', 'dit==1.5')

# numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, rich — pre-installed on Colab, install locally only
if 'google.colab' not in sys.modules:
    _pip('numpy==2.0.2', 'pandas==2.2.2', 'scikit-learn==1.6.1', 'matplotlib==3.10.0', 'rich==13.9.4')
```

### Checking if a package is pre-installed

Before adding a package to the install cell, check:
1. Is it in the pre-installed list above?
2. If unsure, skip it — Colab has 500+ packages pre-installed. If the import works without installing, it's pre-installed.

## NumPy 2.0 Compatibility for Non-Colab Packages

Colab has **numpy 2.0.2**. NumPy 2.0 removed several long-deprecated APIs that older packages still use. If a non-Colab package was written for numpy 1.x, it may crash at runtime with errors like:

- `AttributeError: np.alltrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`
- `AttributeError: np.sometrue was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`
- `AttributeError: np.product was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release`

**Fix**: Add a compat shim in the imports cell (BEFORE importing the affected package):

```python
import numpy as np
if not hasattr(np, "alltrue"): np.alltrue = np.all
if not hasattr(np, "sometrue"): np.sometrue = np.any
if not hasattr(np, "product"): np.product = np.prod
```

**When to add this**: After installing non-Colab packages, test-run the notebook. If you get `AttributeError: np.X was removed`, add the corresponding shim. Common offenders: `dit`, older scientific libraries that haven't been updated for numpy 2.0.

## Colab-Specific Gotchas

1. **No kernel restart after pip install** — Unlike local Jupyter, Colab doesn't cleanly reload C extensions after pip install. Once numpy/scipy/sklearn are loaded, their C code stays in memory forever until full runtime reset.

2. **`%pip` vs `_pip()` helper** — In notebook install cells, use the `_pip()` helper (see pattern above) so you can wrap installs in Python `if` conditionals. `%pip` and `!pip` can't be used inside if/else blocks.

3. **File system** — `/content/` is the working directory. Files persist within a session but are lost on runtime disconnect.

4. **Memory** — Free tier: ~12GB RAM. Pro: ~25-50GB. Monitor with `!free -h`.

5. **Timeouts** — Free tier disconnects after ~90 min idle, ~12 hours max session. Pro: longer.

6. **`%%capture`** — Suppresses all cell output including errors. Only use on install cells AFTER verifying they work. During development, leave install output visible.

## Testing Notebooks Locally (Simulating Colab)

The goal: create a clean Python 3.12 .venv that mirrors Colab's environment, then run the notebook in it.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .nb_env
.nb_env/bin/pip install -q pip jupyter ipykernel
.nb_env/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute code_demo.ipynb --output code_demo.ipynb
rm -rf .nb_env
```

**What happens when the notebook runs in this .venv:**
1. The .venv starts empty (just jupyter + ipykernel)
2. The install cell runs → `google.colab` is NOT in sys.modules
3. Non-Colab packages get installed unconditionally
4. Core packages (numpy, pandas, etc.) get installed at Colab's exact versions via the `google.colab` guard
5. Result: the .venv now has the same packages as Colab + the extra non-Colab packages = as close to Colab as possible

This ensures the notebook works from scratch with an environment matching Colab. If a cell fails, fix the notebook and re-run.

```
Read /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1/method.py (78KB) and live_lib.py (17KB) in that same dir.

Goal: I need to convert this into a small Jupyter demo notebook that runs on CPU in under 10 minutes total, with MINIMAL changes to the original code.

Report back, concisely (no full code dumps, but DO include exact function signatures and exact short code snippets of the core candidate computations — up to ~40 lines each):

1. High-level structure of method.py: the ordered list of top-level sections/functions with line ranges and a one-line description of each.
2. How it is invoked (CLI args, main()).
3. Which functions compute candidates C1, C2, C16 and the logit-only baselines (logit gap, refusal mass) — give their exact names, signatures, line ranges, and paste the actual body of the SMALLEST 2-3 of them verbatim.
4. What inputs they need (model object, tokenizer, prompt pairs, hidden states) and what they return.
5. How SCREEN16 prompts are loaded (file, format) — show 1 example record.
6. Where the per-model row JSON gets written and its schema (list keys of one rows/*.json file).
7. Anything that hard-requires CUDA.

Be concise and factual. Do not modify any files.
```

Source file (READ-ONLY, do not modify): /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_4/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1/analyze_live.py

Task: extract, VERBATIM, the small self-contained numerical/statistical helper functions used to score candidates, and write them into a NEW file:
/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/4_gen_paper_repo/_3_gen_demo_art/notebook_workspaces/iter_4/art_YKxMUIEOomlX/extracted_scoring.py

Specifically find and copy verbatim (keep original names, docstrings, comments):
- the Spearman / rank-correlation helper(s) (e.g. spearman, rankdata, rho_ckpt computation)
- the family-level / aggregation rho helper
- the partial Spearman correlation given covariates (logit_gap, log10(n_params))
- the lineage-clustered bootstrap CI helper(s) (two-sided CI and one-sided lower bound)
- the ICC / design-effect / MDE helper(s)
- the functions that implement the PREREG rules S1, S2 (incl. S2b null-exceedance count), S3 (pole / always-refuse wrapper check), if they are compact standalone functions — if they are inline inside a big function, instead copy just the relevant code block into the file wrapped in a clearly-labelled comment block.

Rules:
- Copy code EXACTLY as written. Do not rewrite, rename, add type hints, or "improve".
- At the top of the new file, add a header comment naming the source file and the line ranges each block came from.
- If a copied function calls another small helper in the same file, copy that helper too.
- Do NOT copy anything requiring torch, GPU, or file IO.

Then reply with: the list of function names copied, each with its source line range and one-line description, and the total line count of the new file. Do not paste the code back to me.
