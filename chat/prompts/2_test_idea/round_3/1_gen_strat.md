<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A strategy planner (Step 3.1: GEN_STRAT in the invention loop)

Each iteration of the invention loop runs: GEN_STRAT → GEN_PLAN → GEN_ART → GEN_PAPER_TEXT → REVIEW_PAPER → UPD_HYPO
Artifact types: RESEARCH (web search), EXPERIMENT (code), DATASET (data collection), EVALUATION (metrics), PROOF (Lean 4)
State persists across iterations: strategies, plans, artifacts, paper_texts (read from the run tree)

You received the hypothesis, iteration status (current + remaining), previous iteration's strategies, available artifact types, existing artifacts, and reviewer feedback.
Your strategy governs THIS iteration only. You define what artifacts to create NOW.

Focused strategy → efficient progress. Scattered strategy → wasted iteration.

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<time_budgets>

Each artifact executor has a fixed time budget (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors):

- research: 3h
- dataset: 6h
- experiment: 6h
- evaluation: 3h
- proof: 3h

</time_budgets>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<research_methodology>
Think like a researcher planning a study for a top venue.

- All strategies run in parallel and their artifacts combine into one pool. Together they must build toward a publishable paper — each strategy contributes a distinct, necessary piece. No strategy should be a standalone island.
- Ask yourself: what would a reviewer need to see? Proper baselines, controlled comparisons, ablations that isolate what matters. Plan artifacts that preempt reviewer objections.
- Depth over breadth. One well-designed experiment with proper controls beats five shallow ones.
- Match your evaluation to your claims. Measure what the hypothesis actually asserts.
- When results are weak or partial, vary the approach before writing it off. One failed method doesn't falsify the hypothesis.
- If iterations remain, think about what the NEXT iteration will need. Leave useful building blocks — datasets, baselines, preliminary results — that future strategies can build on, refine, or compare against.
</research_methodology>

<principles>
1. FOCUS ON NOVELTY - every strategy must lead to a genuinely novel contribution
2. MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION - all artifacts in your strategy run in parallel
3. BUILD ON EXISTING WORK - use completed artifacts from previous iterations, learn from failures
4. ITERATE ON THE METHOD - a negative result is first about the approach, not the hypothesis. Try different methods, parameters, data, or formulations. When the hypothesis itself has been widened, that same energy goes into testing SEVERAL candidate answers at once rather than one of them harder.
5. TWO SHAPES OF ITERATION - a DEEP TEST pushes one claim further; a WIDE SCREEN tests several candidate answers cheaply in parallel and confirms the survivor on held-out evidence. Read which one this iteration is from the hypothesis and the instructions in the user prompt, and build that shape. Never answer a widened hypothesis with one more deep test.
6. NEVER SHRINK TO FIT - do not plan an iteration whose best possible outcome is a smaller, safer version of a claim that already came back weak. If the claim is in trouble, the strategy's job is to put better candidates in play, not to find a corner where the old one survives.
7. DIAGNOSE BEFORE DECIDING - before each iteration, review what worked, what didn't, and why. Use that to choose what to try next. Gaps are action items, not conclusions.
8. SET DEPENDENCIES WISELY - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects referencing existing artifacts; each label is a short free-text type (a word or two, e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends") that tags how the dep is used
9. PLAN FOR DEPENDENCIES - if an artifact depends on another (e.g. experiments need datasets), ensure prerequisites exist first or plan them this iteration for the next
</principles>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<subagent-delegation>
You may delegate bounded work to subagents (e.g. the Task tool). Delegate by default rather than doing everything yourself:

- Pick the cheapest capable model available to you for each subagent launch:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Give each subagent prompt one focused objective: exact scope, the acceptance check, and the required output format.
- Subagents report back only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers — not narration or full logs.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Your own context is the scarcest resource: delegate short tasks too, unless one obvious search-free step beats the handoff.
- Run every orthogonal piece at once: split the work by file or artifact ownership up front, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Escalate to the next tier only after a cheaper subagent failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
- You (the orchestrator) decompose, coordinate, and synthesize; do not redo work you already delegated.
- Verify each result with the smallest reliable check.
</subagent-delegation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_strat/gen_strat_1`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_strat/gen_strat_1/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_strat/gen_strat_1/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_3/gen_strat/gen_strat_1/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace

kind: hypothesis
title: Which internal reads track real safety
hypothesis: |-
  THE CLAIM IN ONE SENTENCE. For a stranger's checkpoint with no parent and no reference, SOME
  single-model internal quantity, read from hidden states or weights on at most 16 prompts, predicts
  that model's MEASURED two-sided safety (it refuses harmful requests AND does not refuse harmless
  look-alikes) across architecture families better than the first-token logit gap does. Which
  quantity is not yet known, and iteration 2 showed that it is none of the 50 static reads already
  registered. Iteration 3 is therefore an explicit SCREEN over a named population of 16 candidates
  in 8 families that can disagree with each other, with a selection rule fixed before any scoring and
  a held-out confirmation the screen never touches. The leading conjecture inside the screen, stated
  so it can lose: what tracks safety is not a LEVEL the model holds but a CAUSAL GAIN, how strongly
  the model's own harm representation drives its own refusal computation, measured by intervention
  or by a weight path, not by a correlation passed through a per-item refusal readout.

  WHAT ITERATION 2 ACTUALLY PRODUCED (executed numbers only).
  (1) THE RACE. 33 of 34 checkpoints, 8 families, registry hash intact. Only 3 of 50 metrics beat
  their own label-permutation null under leave-one-lineage-out. Presentation invariance scored 1.000
  (null p95 0.775). The model-card regex scored 0.917 (0.788), but it reads nothing of the model, its
  name-free twin falls to 0.455, and it fails the blanket-refuser pole rule. The alarming-item logit
  gap scored 0.800 (0.700) and also fails the pole rule. In total 19 metrics fail the pole rule,
  including every black-box refusal meter. The one metric that passes null and poles, presentation
  invariance, runs AGAINST the two-sided target (Spearman -0.71, n=13 checkpoints, and -0.40 at
  lineage level, n=5). The requester's invariant, at least 3 shipped metrics that read hidden states
  or weights, was reported as NOT satisfiable and was not relaxed.
  (2) THE READOUT. No refusal readout met its bar of AUROC >= 0.80 on every checkpoint against judged
  refusal. The chosen cross-fitted probe has minimum 0.544, the logit gap 0.437 with 3 of 15
  checkpoints below chance, and even a graded 24-token greedy continuation only 0.547. Every
  across-item coupling metric was computed THROUGH that readout, so the coupling construct of the
  previous hypothesis (R1) was scored through a near-chance instrument on the very checkpoints that
  matter, the abliterated ones (base rates 0.11 to 0.20).
  (3) THE DIRECTIONS. Cross-fitted harm-content directions clear the within-span random-direction
  null on 16 of 17 checkpoints at the last prompt token inside two families, but on 9 of 17 at the
  first generated token and on 9 of 20 on the 8-family panel. The whitened refit is lower (0.759 vs
  0.835), so part of the read is residual anisotropy.
  (4) THE PROMPT BUDGET (15 checkpoints, 3 families). Black-box reads lead on rank correlation at
  every k (0.282 to 0.337 against 0.021 to 0.210). On held-out balanced accuracy they lead up to
  k=32 and trail at k=64 (0.571 vs 0.592). The activation metamodel reached held-out 0.5 against
  tuned 1.0 at n=10 checkpoints with 288 features, which is a power failure, not a verdict.
  (5) THE WEIGHTS. Verdict EDIT_NOT_RISK. A parent-free recovered edit strength separates edited
  from honest checkpoints (AUROC 0.84, and 0.95 for tool outputs) but does not grade harm: Spearman
  with judged compliance 0.26, CI [-0.65, 0.86], n=14, minimum detectable 0.56. Even the true
  parent-based strength gives 0.03 (n=12). A replication on stored generations gives 0.85 [0.56,
  0.95] at n=20 but mixes edit types, and 0.65 [-0.26, 0.95] on projection edits alone (n=10). So a
  graded weight signal is not established and not excluded. Inside the edited arm the best predictor
  was the logit-only first-token gap (-0.62, p=0.02). The parent-free detection axis was WITHDRAWN:
  best AUROC 0.738 against a 0.80 bar, the published 0.35 threshold flags 97% of honest checkpoints,
  and a zero-prompt spectral repair removes the weight signature (0.012 to 0.82) while harmful
  refusal recovers only 0.125 to 0.208 against the parent's 0.438.
  (6) STEP 1, the Qwen3-4B four-way. The instruct-to-SafeRL and instruct-to-abliterated differences
  share part of a subspace (mean first principal angle 31.1 degrees) but do NOT share a direction:
  mean-difference cosine -0.09, maximum |cos| 0.20 against a null p95 of 0.41, with a powered
  positive control (0.92 > 0.72). Safety tuning and refusal removal are not opposite moves along one
  axis.
  (7) TWO FINISHED POSITIVE RESULTS, kept exactly as measured. Grader-side refusal: the StrongREJECT
  framing makes hosted judges return the minimum grade on 40.5% of replies and 65.9% of harmful-item
  replies, and a stance framing restores agreement (kappa 0.749). The ROSI rank-one safety edit
  REVERSES on a two-sided target on its own Table-1 model: paired change -0.151 [-0.233, -0.065],
  harmful refusal 0.859 to 0.984 while benign-twin false refusal goes 0.375 to 0.750. On Qwen3-0.6B
  the change is direction-consistent but its CI includes zero (-0.081 [-0.176, +0.017]).

  WHY THIS IS WEAK_OR_NULL, AND WHY THE ANSWER IS TO WIDEN. The tests ran and gave nothing to build
  a metric on. Both headline claims of the previous hypothesis failed their own bars: across-item
  metrics did not beat level metrics on held-out lineages, and forgery detection without a reference
  fell under its bar. Shrinking the claim to 'a model-card regex wins' or 'weights read the edit'
  would answer a question the requester did not ask. Three structural causes explain the null, and
  each one is a direction to widen in, not a reason to narrow.
    CAUSE A, THE OUTCOME. The race was scored on a class label carried by only 3 pair-families, and
    the graded two-sided target exists for 13 to 15 checkpoints and 5 to 6 lineages. At n=15 a
    Spearman CI excludes zero only above about 0.51. Nothing short of a very large effect could win.
    CAUSE B, THE INSTRUMENT. Every coupling metric depended on a per-item refusal readout that is
    near chance where it matters. The construct was never cleanly measured.
    CAUSE C, THE POPULATION. The 50 metrics fall in 3 functional classes and are all STATIC reads at
    one site, the last prompt token at a fixed depth. They could not disagree in kind. Step 1 now
    says why a static one-axis read cannot be two-sided: the safety-tuned and refusal-removed
    models do not lie on one axis.

  THE WIDEN: BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ASK. The ask is a cheap single-model safety evaluation from weights
  or activations on a few prompts, preceded by an open-ended look at how Qwen3-4B Base, instruct,
  SafeRL and abliterated differ inside. Sixteen candidates were weighed. All are parent-free, need at
  most 16 prompts, run on sub-4.5B models in bf16 with transformers, and are designed from the
  Step-1 anchor, which is already harvested.
    FAMILY I, CAUSAL GAIN (single-model interventions).
      C1 Harm-to-refusal gain: nudge the model's own cross-fitted harm coordinate at mid depth and
         read the change in its late refusal-axis projection by finite difference. A blanket refuser
         has a high level and near-zero gain, so it loses by construction.
      C2 Self-ablation sensitivity: remove the model's own cross-fitted direction in a layer band
         and read the drop in refusal margin on harmful items and on benign twins, against an
         anisotropy-matched random direction.
      C3 Twin patching flip depth: patch the benign twin's residual into the harmful run in six
         coarse depth bands; read where and how sharply the refusal margin flips.
    FAMILY II, WEIGHT PATHS CONDITIONED ON THE MODEL'S OWN DIRECTIONS (weights plus 16 prompts).
      C4 Writer capacity: how much each o_proj and down_proj can write along the model's own
         refusal axis, as a z-score against random directions from that layer's output span.
      C5 Harm-to-refusal path gain: the bilinear gain from the harm direction into the refusal axis
         through each MLP and attention output path, summed over depth.
    FAMILY III, COMPONENT AND ROUTING STRUCTURE.
      C6 Concentration of direct logit attribution to refusal tokens across heads and MLPs (top-k
         share and depth centroid).
      C7 Late-layer attention mass from the decision position onto the tokens that differ between a
         harmful item and its twin.
      C8 Input-gradient share of the refusal margin on those same differing tokens.
      C9 Template-site share: how much of the refusal drive sits at chat-template positions rather
         than content positions.
    FAMILY IV, DEPTH AND SITE PROFILE.
      C10 Area between the depth curve of harm decodability and the depth curve of refusal drive.
      C11 Refusal-commitment trajectory over the first 8 generated tokens (the response site).
    FAMILY V, TWO-SIDED GEOMETRY.
      C12 Twin discrimination: separation of harmful items from their matched benign twins along
          the refusal axis, relative to separation from plain benign items.
      C13 Presentation invariance with its sign FIXED IN ADVANCE from iteration 2 (negative). It
          must keep that sign at checkpoint and at lineage level or it is dead.
    FAMILY VI, LEARNED. C14 A ridge metamodel on a compact profile of at most 24 depth-by-site
      features predicting the graded target under leave-one-family-out, with an identity control.
    FAMILY VII, LABEL-FREE GEOMETRY. C15 Late-layer effective rank and residual dispersion over the
      16 prompts (low prior; the comparator rows of iteration 2 were weak).
    FAMILY VIII, STEERING DOSE. C16 Self-steering dose-response slope. Prior art exists, so this row
      is a comparator and cannot be shipped as new.
  INCUMBENT BARS, printed as rows and never as candidates: the first-token logit gap and refusal
  token mass (the only 2 logit-only baselines allowed in the shipped set), the card regex and its
  name-free twin, family label alone, log size alone, AMS in its published and cross-fitted forms,
  HRCI, N-GLARE JSS, and the parent-free weight reads (recovered edit strength, BOTGAP).

  THE OUTCOME, CHANGED. Candidates are scored against a GRADED two-sided score per checkpoint, built
  so a model that refuses everything sits at 0.5 and loses, judged with the stance-framed instrument
  and never with Qwen3Guard on SafeRL. The panel must grow from 15 to at least 30 graded checkpoints
  with activations across at least 6 families, including real blanket refusers and standalone models
  with no sibling. It starts from the 20 activation harvests and the stored generations already on
  disk. Below n=24 no correlation is reported as a verdict, only as a scatter. Published numbers
  (HELM safety with its over-refusal scenario, AIR-Bench, model cards) and archived GSM8K and MMLU
  enter as a second outcome column and as a capability partial. The run has already measured that
  only 2 sub-4B models carry published safety numbers and that identical weights differ by up to
  6.7x the across-model variance under different guardians, so the external limb is reported with
  its n and is not the selection criterion.

  SELECTION RULE, FIXED BEFORE ANY SCORING. A candidate SURVIVES the screen only if all six hold.
  (S1) Under leave-one-family-out (leave-one-lineage-out where a family has no pair), its |Spearman|
  with the graded score exceeds the first-token logit gap's by at least 0.15 with a family-cluster
  bootstrap CI on the difference that excludes zero, OR its partial correlation given the logit gap
  and log size has a CI excluding zero. (S2) It beats its own label-permutation null p95 and, for
  direction-based reads, the within-span random-direction null. (S3) Its orientation is declared in
  advance, and both a real blanket refuser and the wrapped always-refuse and never-refuse poles score
  WORSE than the honest instruct model. (S4) Its sign agrees between checkpoint-level and
  family-level aggregation. (S5) It holds at k <= 16 prompts and under two minutes per 4B model on
  one 16 GB GPU. (S6) It beats the family-only and size-only rows. As a control on Cause B, every
  readout-dependent row is also printed with judged refusal as an oracle readout, which separates 'the
  construct fails' from 'the readout fails'. Rival outcomes are informative. If Families I or II
  win, coupling was real and the iteration-2 null was the instrument. If Family III wins, structure
  rather than gain carries safety. If only the bars win, the evidence points to a bound: at 16
  prompts nothing internal beats the logit gap, with its minimum detectable effect stated. That
  bound would be written up only on the final iteration.

  HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION, USED
</pasted_content id="8d1c">


<pasted_content id="8d1c">
 ONCE. The two sealed families that no iteration has touched (Granite
  and StableLM2), a sealed
  item pool from which a fresh set of 16 prompts is drawn, and checkpoints harvested only after the
  screen is frozen. A screen winner is a CANDIDATE, not a finding. If confirmation fails, that
  candidate is dead, and there is no re-screening and no subgroup search on the confirmation data.
  The shipped set is up to the 3 best confirmed internal metrics plus at most 2 logit-only
  baselines. If fewer than 3 internal metrics confirm, the invariant is reported as unmet.

  WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FORGERY AXIS. It stops being a headline and becomes a ROBUSTNESS COLUMN for
  survivors only. The 183 stored weight-ladder cells and 11 graded behavioural cells can be re-scored
  without re-running an edit. The previous hypothesis's rank-zero cancellation claim becomes one
  testable prediction: a causal-gain metric should not move under a constant residual offset that
  moves every level metric.

  BONUS, CONDITIONAL. For any confirmed survivor: which layers and components carry it on the
  Qwen3-4B anchor, what breaks it, reported as a distribution over seeds and prompt draws rather
  than as one circuit. C14 is the requested metamodel and competes under the same rule.

  REPORTING CORRECTIONS CARRIED FORWARD FROM REVIEW. Every headline sentence must match its full
  table: the card regex is 'the best metric that reads nothing', not the best metric; the prompt
  budget is reported on both scales; the 0.85 replication and its edit-type confound sit beside the
  n=14 null; all three direction-null counts (16/17, 9/17, 9/20) appear together; the repair result
  quotes refusal, not compliance; the Qwen3 ROSI result is 'direction-consistent, not significant';
  every number is tagged with its panel; Step 1, Step 5, the metamodel and the external limb are
  reported even where negative; the bibliography is regenerated by identifier.
motivation: |-
  Anyone who downloads a model from Hugging Face is trusting an artifact uploaded by a stranger. There
  are well over a million of them, almost none carry safety numbers, and running a benchmark on each is
  out of the question. So the field is building cheap proxies: read a few weights, run a handful of
  prompts, get an estimate in seconds. Every one of them is selected the same way - correlate it with
  benchmark scores across honest checkpoints and keep the winner.

  Two things are wrong with that, and this study fixes one and measures the other.

  The first is that nobody has checked WHICH cheap readouts survive being moved to a lineage they were
  not tuned on. That is the request's own question and it has a mechanical answer waiting: published
  work shows harmful intent is linearly decodable at around 0.98 AUROC in essentially every checkpoint,
  including abliterated ones, which means a readout of what the model KNOWS is near-constant across
  alignment variants and cannot possibly separate them. What varies is whether refusal uses the
  knowledge. That is a statement about a relationship across items, not about a level, and it predicts
  in advance which half of any 50-metric battery can work. Testing it held-out is the cheap, decisive
  version of the request, and it is worth doing on its own.

  The second is that the selection rule assumes honesty. The cheapest proxies read the most superficial
  thing a model does, and the most superficial thing is the cheapest to change. A chat template is a
  text file inside the repository. A system prompt is thirty tokens. A rank-one addition to the
  residual-write matrices needs no training data and no gradient step - and it is not hypothetical, it
  is a published method its authors present as a cheap safety improvement, validated with a guard
  model's refusal rate and a benign-compliance check on ordinary prompts, never on the
  benign-but-alarming requests where pushing a model toward refusal actually does its damage. Whether
  that edit is a defence or a fake depends on a measurement nobody made.

  So the question is not which cheap metric correlates best. It is which cheap metric you could still
  believe if the person who uploaded the model wanted you to believe it. And the honest version of that
  has a second half: an edit that is cheap to apply may also be cheap to CATCH. A template preamble is a
  free text read. A shared direction written into every residual-write matrix is a subspace that recurs across
  layers, which one pass over the weights can see - and a public scanner already does exactly that, which is
  better for this argument than inventing our own detector would have been, because the screen an auditor
  faces should be one they can already download. A forgery is only worth worrying about if it is cheap AND
  invisible, and that pairing is the measurement nobody has made.

  There is a reason to expect a clean answer rather than a mess. Faking a metric and satisfying it
  honestly are not unrelated activities. To make a model refuse harmful requests and only those, a
  forger must give it something that tells harmful from harmless, which is the safety mechanism itself.
  The cheap edits stop short of that in a specific, algebraic way: a constant cannot condition on the
  item at all, and a rank-one edit can condition only through a single coordinate - which is exactly the
  structure that recurs across layers and can be read. So the cost of an undetectable forgery should
  converge on the cost of actually being safe, and the metrics that are cheap to fake are the ones
  asking for less than that. Forgery cost is then not a security curiosity bolted onto evaluation; it is
  a measurement of how much real safety each metric is actually demanding, which is the thing nobody
  currently knows about any of them.

  Tamper-resistance work is the published mirror image: it measures what it costs to REMOVE real safety
  from an open-weight model. We measure what it costs to FAKE the appearance of it. The two bound a
  safety metric from opposite sides and only one has been measured.

  Finally, this settles on the right axis a question the field keeps answering wrongly. Careful attempts
  to show that reading a model's internals beats reading its outputs have failed: a plain refusal rate
  predicts benchmark safety about as well as anything measured inside, and the model card does better
  still. The conclusion drawn so far is that looking inside buys nothing. The alternative is that
  looking inside has only ever been judged on the one axis where behaviour is unbeatable by
  construction - predicting behaviour on honest models - instead of the two axes where behaviour is not
  a reliable witness: a lineage nobody tuned on, and a checkpoint shipped by someone with a reason to
  shape how it behaves.
assumptions:
- |-
  A shared-direction weight edit leaves an aligned subspace across the layers it touches, and the degree
  of that alignment is large enough, and honest cross-layer alignment small enough, to separate them with no
  parent. The spectrum-invariance half is no longer an assumption: the statistic is a subspace overlap, so it
  discards singular values, and in simulation its honest value moved only from 0.168 to 0.177 between a
  Gaussian and a heavy-tailed weight spectrum where the statistic it replaces swung from 0.821 to 0.119. What
  remains empirical is the honest baseline on real trained weights, which real networks could violate by
  carrying genuinely shared directions of their own, and the alignment REAL abliteration tools actually
  produce. Both are measured in Stage 0 before anything is built on them. The card census already narrows the
  risk: only about 5 percent of real abliterated checkpoints state a per-layer direction, and the dominant
  automated tool searches over direction scope rather than defaulting to per-layer, with 8 of 10 published
  parameter tables using a global direction. If real honest checkpoints turn out to have high cross-layer
  alignment of their own, the sharing statistic is withdrawn and the local rank-deficiency statistic carries
  the full-strength cases alone.
- |-
  The two training-free text rungs are genuinely cheap and genuinely fake: a repository-file edit and a
  constant refusal offset must be implementable with no training data and no gradient steps and must
  leave graded harmful output essentially unchanged. The rank-one rung is explicitly NOT assumed to be a
  fake - it is a published method presented as a defence, so its label is an OUTCOME of this study, and
  if it survives a ground truth that penalises a blanket refuser we relabel it a cheap defence and report
  a shorter ladder. Symmetrically, the constant rung is not assumed to be undetectable: whether it can be
  built without adding a tensor the declared architecture lacks is a measured result, and if it cannot,
  the undetectable-cost column may collapse to a constant, which is itself a clean finding.
- |-
  Harmful intent is close to linearly decodable from the residual stream of essentially every checkpoint
  when the direction is CROSS-FITTED, not merely in-sample. Published work puts this near 0.98 AUROC
  across four families and three alignment variants including abliterated ones, so the assumption is well
  supported - but it cuts both ways, since it also means a harm-knowledge readout is near-constant across
  variants and cannot be the discriminator. If cross-fitted decoding sits at chance at our item budget for
  some family, the item count at which the signal lifts is itself the finding: a floor on how cheap an
  internal safety metric can be.
- |-
  Enough honest checkpoints exist to support the panels. At least six ungated lineages at or below about
  four billion parameters with readable safetensors and a usable chat template for the ground-truth panel;
  at least 120 ungated instruct checkpoints for the threshold and manifold panel, whose metric vectors need
  no ground truth at all; and at least 30 real abliterated sub-4B checkpoints for the recipe census and the
  transfer panel. A Hub query for safetensors instruct text-generation checkpoints returns over a thousand
  results with about four percent gated, and a search for abliterated returns over a thousand hits with
  roughly 150 under 4B, so all three are reachable.
- |-
  The external correlation limb is carried by MODEL SIZE STRATIFICATION, not by finding more small models,
  because we checked and the small ones are not there: across the three public safety leaderboards with
  downloadable per-model tables, the sub-4B open-weight population is 3, 1 and 1 respectively, and a fourth
  publishes no per-model table. The assumption the limb rests on is therefore that the two weight-only
  readouts, needing only a safetensors read on CPU, and the two activation readouts, being prefill-only, can
  be computed on the 7-8B-and-up open-weight models in those pools - roughly 25 to 40 after API-only entries
  are removed - within the machine's RAM and the run's transfer budget. Capability is not scarce at any size:
  the archived open leaderboard holds over ten thousand result files. If the large-model stratum proves
  unusable, the limb falls back to the six-to-eight sub-4B checkpoints plus in-house grading, with the subset
  size reported prominently and the scarcity itself reported as the ecosystem finding it is.
investigation_approach: |-
  STAGE 0 - PRECONDITION CHECKS, RUN FIRST, ABOUT THREE HOURS. Four cheap results decide the shape of
  everything after them and each is pre-committed.
    (i) THE RECIPE CENSUS. The card half of this is ALREADY DONE and its numbers are in H3 claim 3c: 37
    real abliterated Hub checkpoints read, 8.1 percent matching the recipe the previous statistic required,
    5.4 percent stating a per-layer direction, 56.8 percent stating no recipe at all. Stage 0 completes it
    from the WEIGHTS, which is where the 56.8 percent has to be resolved: for each census checkpoint recover
    every layer's suppressed direction as its bottom left singular vector, then measure the realised
    ablation strength, which layers were touched, and the mean pairwise cosine across layers. That cosine is
    the axis H3 grades the instrument on, so it is measured on real artifacts before anything is built on it.
    One census by-product is kept as a free positive control: the same author ships checkpoints fine-tuned to
    INCREASE refusal, which are a ready-made real-world blanket-refuser anchor for H5's poles.
    (ii) THE INSTRUMENT ON REAL WEIGHTS. Compute bottom- and top-subspace alignment and the local
    rank-deficiency ratio on every census checkpoint and on a first slice of the honest panel, plus on two
    edits we construct ourselves on a checkpoint we control - one rank-one injection at the published
    method's own alpha, one abliteration. The honest baseline is validated on real weights, not on
    simulation. The withdrawal path is finer-grained than before: if the sharing statistic fails, it is
    withdrawn for that rung and plain forgery cost is reported there; if the local statistic also fails on
    real full-strength abliterations, the whole detection axis is withdrawn and the study reverts to the
    plain cost ladder plus R1, which remains a complete deliverable.
    NOTE ON THE ANCHOR, found in the census and worth stating because it changes Stage 1's model list: the
    best-known abliterated Qwen3 checkpoints from one publisher now return 401 and are no longer openly
    downloadable, so the anchor lineage's abliterated member is taken from a still-open alternative produced
    by the automated tool, with the gated ones used only if access is granted.
    (iii) CROSS-FITTED TRANSFER on the anchor lineage: harm-direction decoding plain, wrapped, paraphrased
    and translated, so the audit draw's presentation pool is characterised before it is used.
    (iv) THE INVARIANCE NUMBER: apply the constant rung on an fp32 copy and measure how far each
    across-item metric moves against the 0.05 tolerance, and settle how F2a is built - carrier coordinate
    or explicit tensor - by measuring the realised across-item constancy of both.

Inspect the workspace `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1` (an ML-safety experiment: "Cheap safety meters tested across eight model families"; it harvested hidden-state activations from ~33 small LLM checkpoints and raced 50 metrics). A planner for the NEXT iteration needs to know exactly what reusable data is on disk. Avoid reading huge files fully (use ls -la, du -sh, head, python json key listing; never cat files > 50KB).

Report, with ABSOLUTE PATHS and counts:
1. Top-level directory layout with sizes (du -sh per subdir).
2. Activation harvests: which directory, how many checkpoint subdirs have a completion marker (e.g. DONE), list of the checkpoint slugs/HF repo ids grouped by model family, what files each holds (names, sizes), and what is inside one acts file (np.load keys, array shapes: which layers, which token sites e.g. last prompt token / first generated token, how many items). Whether RAW per-item per-layer activations are saved (vs. only summaries).
3. Stored generations: per checkpoint, how many items have generated text; whether judge grades (refusal/compliance, stance-framed judge) are stored per item and where; how many checkpoints have a GRADED two-sided score (harmful refusal AND benign-twin false refusal) and the file that holds it.
4. The item sets used: files, counts, whether harmful items have matched benign twins (XSTest-style pairs), and whether any "sealed" item pool or sealed families (Granite, StableLM2) are declared, and whether anything has leaked (any harvest dir or results row for granite or stablelm).
5. The panel file: the list of checkpoints planned vs harvested, family per checkpoint, which are abliterated / safety-tuned / blanket-refuser / standalone.
6. Hardware actually used (look in logs or meta for cuda / GPU name / cpu-only, per-checkpoint harvest wall time).
7. Key reusable code modules (file names + one line each), especially harvesting, direction fitting (cross-fitted harm/refusal directions), judge calls, pole wrappers (always-refuse / never-refuse), leave-one-family-out scoring.
8. Any documented deviations/failures (README, DEVIATIONS, summary.json flags).
