<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviser (Step 3.6: UPD_HYPO in the invention loop)

You received the current hypothesis, all artifacts, and the paper draft.
Revise the hypothesis based on what the evidence supports.

Honest revision → focused research. Inflated confidence → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

You are deciding where a research run points next, using the evidence it
gathered this iteration. Your revised hypothesis IS the next iteration's
hypothesis — nothing else steers the run — so this is a steering decision
first and a piece of honest reflection second.

SCOPE: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. You do NOT run code,
produce artifacts, fix bugs, or otherwise act on the evidence yourself — the
next iteration of the invention loop will spawn fresh artifacts based on your
revised hypothesis. Reflect on the evidence and rewrite the hypothesis;
nothing else.

PRINCIPLES:
- Ground every revision in specific artifacts and results. A number that was
  projected, assumed or left as a placeholder is not a result.
- CLASSIFY THE EVIDENCE BEFORE CHOOSING A MOVE. The move follows from the
  classification and the remaining budget by a fixed rule; it is not a
  free judgement, because that is exactly where past runs went wrong.
- A weak or null result with budget left is a signal to go WIDER, not
  smaller. The question the user asked is still open; the answer you tried
  is the only thing that was refuted.
- Never shrink the claim until the effect you happened to observe becomes
  the claim. A finding nobody needed is worse than an honest negative.
- A clean negative result is a LAST RESORT, not a deliverable. It is the
  right output only when no iteration and no candidate remain.
- Increase specificity as evidence accumulates; do not inflate confidence
  without strong evidence.
- Revise hypothesis text only — never attempt to address feedback by running
  code, proposing fixes, or producing artifacts; the next loop iteration
  handles all artifact generation.

<subagent-delegation>
You may delegate bounded work to subagents (e.g. the Task tool). Delegate by default rather than doing everything yourself:

- Pick the cheapest capable model available to you for each subagent launch:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Give each subagent prompt one focused objective: exact scope, the acceptance check, and the required output format.
- Subagents report back only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers — not narration or full logs.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Your own context is the scarcest resource: delegate short tasks too, unless one obvious search-free step beats the handoff.
- Run every orthogonal piece at once: split the work by file or artifact ownership up front, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Escalate to the next tier only after a cheaper subagent failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
- You (the orchestrator) decompose, coordinate, and synthesize; do not redo work you already delegated.
- Verify each result with the smallest reliable check.

title: Which internal reads track real safety
hypothesis: |-
  THE CLAIM IN ONE SENTENCE. For a stranger's checkpoint with no parent and no reference, SOME
  single-model internal quantity, read from hidden states or weights on at most 16 prompts, predicts
  that model's MEASURED two-sided safety (it refuses harmful requests AND does not refuse harmless
  look-alikes) across architecture families better than the first-token logit gap does. Which
  quantity is not yet known, and iteration 2 showed that it is none of the 50 static reads already
  registered. Iteration 3 is therefore an explicit SCREEN over a named population of 16 candidates
  in 8 families that can disagree with each other, with a selection rule fixed before any scoring and
  a held-out confirmation the screen never touches. The leading conjecture inside the screen, stated
  so it can lose: what tracks safety is not a LEVEL the model holds but a CAUSAL GAIN, how strongly
  the model's own harm representation drives its own refusal computation, measured by intervention
  or by a weight path, not by a correlation passed through a per-item refusal readout.

  WHAT ITERATION 2 ACTUALLY PRODUCED (executed numbers only).
  (1) THE RACE. 33 of 34 checkpoints, 8 families, registry hash intact. Only 3 of 50 metrics beat
  their own label-permutation null under leave-one-lineage-out. Presentation invariance scored 1.000
  (null p95 0.775). The model-card regex scored 0.917 (0.788), but it reads nothing of the model, its
  name-free twin falls to 0.455, and it fails the blanket-refuser pole rule. The alarming-item logit
  gap scored 0.800 (0.700) and also fails the pole rule. In total 19 metrics fail the pole rule,
  including every black-box refusal meter. The one metric that passes null and poles, presentation
  invariance, runs AGAINST the two-sided target (Spearman -0.71, n=13 checkpoints, and -0.40 at
  lineage level, n=5). The requester's invariant, at least 3 shipped metrics that read hidden states
  or weights, was reported as NOT satisfiable and was not relaxed.
  (2) THE READOUT. No refusal readout met its bar of AUROC >= 0.80 on every checkpoint against judged
  refusal. The chosen cross-fitted probe has minimum 0.544, the logit gap 0.437 with 3 of 15
  checkpoints below chance, and even a graded 24-token greedy continuation only 0.547. Every
  across-item coupling metric was computed THROUGH that readout, so the coupling construct of the
  previous hypothesis (R1) was scored through a near-chance instrument on the very checkpoints that
  matter, the abliterated ones (base rates 0.11 to 0.20).
  (3) THE DIRECTIONS. Cross-fitted harm-content directions clear the within-span random-direction
  null on 16 of 17 checkpoints at the last prompt token inside two families, but on 9 of 17 at the
  first generated token and on 9 of 20 on the 8-family panel. The whitened refit is lower (0.759 vs
  0.835), so part of the read is residual anisotropy.
  (4) THE PROMPT BUDGET (15 checkpoints, 3 families). Black-box reads lead on rank correlation at
  every k (0.282 to 0.337 against 0.021 to 0.210). On held-out balanced accuracy they lead up to
  k=32 and trail at k=64 (0.571 vs 0.592). The activation metamodel reached held-out 0.5 against
  tuned 1.0 at n=10 checkpoints with 288 features, which is a power failure, not a verdict.
  (5) THE WEIGHTS. Verdict EDIT_NOT_RISK. A parent-free recovered edit strength separates edited
  from honest checkpoints (AUROC 0.84, and 0.95 for tool outputs) but does not grade harm: Spearman
  with judged compliance 0.26, CI [-0.65, 0.86], n=14, minimum detectable 0.56. Even the true
  parent-based strength gives 0.03 (n=12). A replication on stored generations gives 0.85 [0.56,
  0.95] at n=20 but mixes edit types, and 0.65 [-0.26, 0.95] on projection edits alone (n=10). So a
  graded weight signal is not established and not excluded. Inside the edited arm the best predictor
  was the logit-only first-token gap (-0.62, p=0.02). The parent-free detection axis was WITHDRAWN:
  best AUROC 0.738 against a 0.80 bar, the published 0.35 threshold flags 97% of honest checkpoints,
  and a zero-prompt spectral repair removes the weight signature (0.012 to 0.82) while harmful
  refusal recovers only 0.125 to 0.208 against the parent's 0.438.
  (6) STEP 1, the Qwen3-4B four-way. The instruct-to-SafeRL and instruct-to-abliterated differences
  share part of a subspace (mean first principal angle 31.1 degrees) but do NOT share a direction:
  mean-difference cosine -0.09, maximum |cos| 0.20 against a null p95 of 0.41, with a powered
  positive control (0.92 > 0.72). Safety tuning and refusal removal are not opposite moves along one
  axis.
  (7) TWO FINISHED POSITIVE RESULTS, kept exactly as measured. Grader-side refusal: the StrongREJECT
  framing makes hosted judges return the minimum grade on 40.5% of replies and 65.9% of harmful-item
  replies, and a stance framing restores agreement (kappa 0.749). The ROSI rank-one safety edit
  REVERSES on a two-sided target on its own Table-1 model: paired change -0.151 [-0.233, -0.065],
  harmful refusal 0.859 to 0.984 while benign-twin false refusal goes 0.375 to 0.750. On Qwen3-0.6B
  the change is direction-consistent but its CI includes zero (-0.081 [-0.176, +0.017]).

  WHY THIS IS WEAK_OR_NULL, AND WHY THE ANSWER IS TO WIDEN. The tests ran and gave nothing to build
  a metric on. Both headline claims of the previous hypothesis failed their own bars: across-item
  metrics did not beat level metrics on held-out lineages, and forgery detection without a reference
  fell under its bar. Shrinking the claim to 'a model-card regex wins' or 'weights read the edit'
  would answer a question the requester did not ask. Three structural causes explain the null, and
  each one is a direction to widen in, not a reason to narrow.
    CAUSE A, THE OUTCOME. The race was scored on a class label carried by only 3 pair-families, and
    the graded two-sided target exists for 13 to 15 checkpoints and 5 to 6 lineages. At n=15 a
    Spearman CI excludes zero only above about 0.51. Nothing short of a very large effect could win.
    CAUSE B, THE INSTRUMENT. Every coupling metric depended on a per-item refusal readout that is
    near chance where it matters. The construct was never cleanly measured.
    CAUSE C, THE POPULATION. The 50 metrics fall in 3 functional classes and are all STATIC reads at
    one site, the last prompt token at a fixed depth. They could not disagree in kind. Step 1 now
    says why a static one-axis read cannot be two-sided: the safety-tuned and refusal-removed
    models do not lie on one axis.

  THE WIDEN: BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ASK. The ask is a cheap single-model safety evaluation from weights
  or activations on a few prompts, preceded by an open-ended look at how Qwen3-4B Base, instruct,
  SafeRL and abliterated differ inside. Sixteen candidates were weighed. All are parent-free, need at
  most 16 prompts, run on sub-4.5B models in bf16 with transformers, and are designed from the
  Step-1 anchor, which is already harvested.
    FAMILY I, CAUSAL GAIN (single-model interventions).
      C1 Harm-to-refusal gain: nudge the model's own cross-fitted harm coordinate at mid depth and
         read the change in its late refusal-axis projection by finite difference. A blanket refuser
         has a high level and near-zero gain, so it loses by construction.
      C2 Self-ablation sensitivity: remove the model's own cross-fitted direction in a layer band
         and read the drop in refusal margin on harmful items and on benign twins, against an
         anisotropy-matched random direction.
      C3 Twin patching flip depth: patch the benign twin's residual into the harmful run in six
         coarse depth bands; read where and how sharply the refusal margin flips.
    FAMILY II, WEIGHT PATHS CONDITIONED ON THE MODEL'S OWN DIRECTIONS (weights plus 16 prompts).
      C4 Writer capacity: how much each o_proj and down_proj can write along the model's own
         refusal axis, as a z-score against random directions from that layer's output span.
      C5 Harm-to-refusal path gain: the bilinear gain from the harm direction into the refusal axis
         through each MLP and attention output path, summed over depth.
    FAMILY III, COMPONENT AND ROUTING STRUCTURE.
      C6 Concentration of direct logit attribution to refusal tokens across heads and MLPs (top-k
         share and depth centroid).
      C7 Late-layer attention mass from the decision position onto the tokens that differ between a
         harmful item and its twin.
      C8 Input-gradient share of the refusal margin on those same differing tokens.
      C9 Template-site share: how much of the refusal drive sits at chat-template positions rather
         than content positions.
    FAMILY IV, DEPTH AND SITE PROFILE.
      C10 Area between the depth curve of harm decodability and the depth curve of refusal drive.
      C11 Refusal-commitment trajectory over the first 8 generated tokens (the response site).
    FAMILY V, TWO-SIDED GEOMETRY.
      C12 Twin discrimination: separation of harmful items from their matched benign twins along
          the refusal axis, relative to separation from plain benign items.
      C13 Presentation invariance with its sign FIXED IN ADVANCE from iteration 2 (negative). It
          must keep that sign at checkpoint and at lineage level or it is dead.
    FAMILY VI, LEARNED. C14 A ridge metamodel on a compact profile of at most 24 depth-by-site
      features predicting the graded target under leave-one-family-out, with an identity control.
    FAMILY VII, LABEL-FREE GEOMETRY. C15 Late-layer effective rank and residual dispersion over the
      16 prompts (low prior; the comparator rows of iteration 2 were weak).
    FAMILY VIII, STEERING DOSE. C16 Self-steering dose-response slope. Prior art exists, so this row
      is a comparator and cannot be shipped as new.
  INCUMBENT BARS, printed as rows and never as candidates: the first-token logit gap and refusal
  token mass (the only 2 logit-only baselines allowed in the shipped set), the card regex and its
  name-free twin, family label alone, log size alone, AMS in its published and cross-fitted forms,
  HRCI, N-GLARE JSS, and the parent-free weight reads (recovered edit strength, BOTGAP).

  THE OUTCOME, CHANGED. Candidates are scored against a GRADED two-sided score per checkpoint, built
  so a model that refuses everything sits at 0.5 and loses, judged with the stance-framed instrument
  and never with Qwen3Guard on SafeRL. The panel must grow from 15 to at least 30 graded checkpoints
  with activations across at least 6 families, including real blanket refusers and standalone models
  with no sibling. It starts from the 20 activation harvests and the stored generations already on
  disk. Below n=24 no correlation is reported as a verdict, only as a scatter. Published numbers
  (HELM safety with its over-refusal scenario, AIR-Bench, model cards) and archived GSM8K and MMLU
  enter as a second outcome column and as a capability partial. The run has already measured that
  only 2 sub-4B models carry published safety numbers and that identical weights differ by up to
  6.7x the across-model variance under different guardians, so the external limb is reported with
  its n and is not the selection criterion.

  SELECTION RULE, FIXED BEFORE ANY SCORING. A candidate SURVIVES the screen only if all six hold.
  (S1) Under leave-one-family-out (leave-one-lineage-out where a family has no pair), its |Spearman|
  with the graded score exceeds the first-token logit gap's by at least 0.15 with a family-cluster
  bootstrap CI on the difference that excludes zero, OR its partial correlation given the logit gap
  and log size has a CI excluding zero. (S2) It beats its own label-permutation null p95 and, for
  direction-based reads, the within-span random-direction null. (S3) Its orientation is declared in
  advance, and both a real blanket refuser and the wrapped always-refuse and never-refuse poles score
  WORSE than the honest instruct model. (S4) Its sign agrees between checkpoint-level and
  family-level aggregation. (S5) It holds at k <= 16 prompts and under two minutes per 4B model on
  one 16 GB GPU. (S6) It beats the family-only and size-only rows. As a control on Cause B, every
  readout-dependent row is also printed with judged refusal as an oracle readout, which separates 'the
  construct fails' from 'the readout fails'. Rival outcomes are informative. If Families I or II
  win, coupling was real and the iteration-2 null was the instrument. If Family III wins, structure
  rather than gain carries safety. If only the bars win, the evidence points to a bound: at 16
  prompts nothing internal beats the logit gap, with its minimum detectable effect stated. That
  bound would be written up only on the final iteration.

  HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION, USED ONCE. The two sealed families that no iteration has touched (Granite
  and StableLM2), a sealed
  item pool from which a fresh set of 16 prompts is drawn, and checkpoints harvested only after the
  screen is frozen. A screen winner is a CANDIDATE, not a finding. If confirmation fails, that
  candidate is dead, and there is no re-screening and no subgroup search on the confirmation data.
  The shipped set is up to the 3 best confirmed internal metrics plus at most 2 logit-only
  baselines. If fewer than 3 internal metrics confirm, the invariant is reported as unmet.

  WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FORGERY AXIS. It stops being a headline and becomes a ROBUSTNESS COLUMN for
  survivors only. The 183 stored weight-ladder cells and 11 graded behavioural cells can be re-scored
  without re-running an edit. The previous hypothesis's rank-zero cancellation claim becomes one
  testable prediction: a causal-gain metric should not move under a constant residual offset that
  moves every level metric.

  BONUS, CONDITIONAL. For any confirmed survivor: which layers and components carry it on the
  Qwen3-4B anchor, what breaks it, reported as a distribution over seeds and prompt draws rather
  than as one circuit. C14 is the requested metamodel and competes under the same rule.

  REPORTING CORRECTIONS CARRIED FORWARD FROM REVIEW. Every headline sentence must match its full
  table: the card regex is 'the best metric that reads nothing', not the best metric; the prompt
  budget is reported on both scales; the 0.85 replication and its edit-type confound sit beside the
  n=14 null; all three direction-null counts (16/17, 9/17, 9/20) appear together; the repair result
  quotes refusal, not compliance; the Qwen3 ROSI result is 'direction-consistent, not significant';
  every number is tagged with its panel; Step 1, Step 5, the metamodel and the external limb are
  reported even where negative; the bibliography is regenerated by identifier.
motivation: |-
  Anyone who downloads a model from Hugging Face is trusting an artifact uploaded by a stranger. There
  are well over a million of them, almost none carry safety numbers, and running a benchmark on each is
  out of the question. So the field is building cheap proxies: read a few weights, run a handful of
  prompts, get an estimate in seconds. Every one of them is selected the same way - correlate it with
  benchmark scores across honest checkpoints and keep the winner.

  Two things are wrong with that, and this study fixes one and measures the other.

  The first is that nobody has checked WHICH cheap readouts survive being moved to a lineage they were
  not tuned on. That is the request's own question and it has a mechanical answer waiting: published
  work shows harmful intent is linearly decodable at around 0.98 AUROC in essentially every checkpoint,
  including abliterated ones, which means a readout of what the model KNOWS is near-constant across
  alignment variants and cannot possibly separate them. What varies is whether refusal uses the
  knowledge. That is a statement about a relationship across items, not about a level, and it predicts
  in advance which half of any 50-metric battery can work. Testing it held-out is the cheap, decisive
  version of the request, and it is worth doing on its own.

  The second is that the selection rule assumes honesty. The cheapest proxies read the most superficial
  thing a model does, and the most superficial thing is the cheapest to change. A chat template is a
  text file inside the repository. A system prompt is thirty tokens. A rank-one addition to the
  residual-write matrices needs no training data and no gradient step - and it is not hypothetical, it
  is a published method its authors present as a cheap safety improvement, validated with a guard
  model's refusal rate and a benign-compliance check on ordinary prompts, never on the
  benign-but-alarming requests where pushing a model toward refusal actually does its damage. Whether
  that edit is a defence or a fake depends on a measurement nobody made.

  So the question is not which cheap metric correlates best. It is which cheap metric you could still
  believe if the person who uploaded the model wanted you to believe it. And the honest version of that
  has a second half: an edit that is cheap to apply may also be cheap to CATCH. A template preamble is a
  free text read. A shared direction written into every residual-write matrix is a subspace that recurs across
  layers, which one pass over the weights can see - and a public scanner already does exactly that, which is
  better for this argument than inventing our own detector would have been, because the screen an auditor
  faces should be one they can already download. A forgery is only worth worrying about if it is cheap AND
  invisible, and that pairing is the measurement nobody has made.

  There is a reason to expect a clean answer rather than a mess. Faking a metric and satisfying it
  honestly are not unrelated activities. To make a model refuse harmful requests and only those, a
  forger must give it something that tells harmful from harmless, which is the safety mechanism itself.
  The cheap edits stop short of that in a specific, algebraic way: a constant cannot condition on the
  item at all, and a rank-one edit can condition only through a single coordinate - which is exactly the
  structure that recurs across layers and can be read. So the cost of an undetectable forgery should
  converge on the cost of actually being safe, and the metrics that are cheap to fake are the ones
  asking for less than that. Forgery cost is then not a security curiosity bolted onto evaluation; it is
  a measurement of how much real safety each metric is actually demanding, which is the thing nobody
  currently knows about any of them.

  Tamper-resistance work is the published mirror image: it measures what it costs to REMOVE real safety
  from an open-weight model. We measure what it costs to FAKE the appearance of it. The two bound a
  safety metric from opposite sides and only one has been measured.

  Finally, this settles on the right axis a question the field keeps answering wrongly. Careful attempts
  to show that reading a model's internals beats reading its outputs have failed: a plain refusal rate
  predicts benchmark safety about as well as anything measured inside, and the model card does better
  still. The conclusion drawn so far is that looking inside buys nothing. The alternative is that
  looking inside has only ever been judged on the one axis where behaviour is unbeatable by
  construction - predicting behaviour on honest models - instead of the two axes where behaviour is not
  a reliable witness: a lineage nobody tuned on, and a checkpoint shipped by someone with a reason to
  shape how it behaves.
assumptions:
- |-
  A shared-direction weight edit leaves an aligned subspace across the layers it touches, and the degree
  of that alignment is large enough, and honest cross-layer alignment small enough, to separate them with no
  parent. The spectrum-invariance half is no longer an assumption: the statistic is a subspace overlap, so it
  discards singular values, and in simulation its honest value moved only from 0.168 to 0.177 between a
  Gaussian and a heavy-tailed weight spectrum where the statistic it replaces swung from 0.821 to 0.119. What
  remains empirical is the honest baseline on real trained weights, which real networks could violate by
  carrying genuinely shared directions of their own, and the alignment REAL abliteration tools actually
  produce. Both are measured in Stage 0 before anything is built on them. The card census already narrows the
  risk: only about 5 percent of real abliterated checkpoints state a per-layer direction, and the dominant
  automated tool searches over direction scope rather than defaulting to per-layer, with 8 of 10 published
  parameter tables using a global direction. If real honest checkpoints turn out to have high cross-layer
  alignment of their own, the sharing statistic is withdrawn and the local rank-deficiency statistic carries
  the full-strength cases alone.
- |-
  The two training-free text rungs are genuinely cheap and genuinely fake: a repository-file edit and a
  constant refusal offset must be implementable with no training data and no gradient steps and must
  leave graded harmful output essentially unchanged. The rank-one rung is explicitly NOT assumed to be a
  fake - it is a published method presented as a defence, so its label is an OUTCOME of this study, and
  if it survives a ground truth that penalises a blanket refuser we relabel it a cheap defence and report
  a shorter ladder. Symmetrically, the constant rung is not assumed to be undetectable: whether it can be
  built without adding a tensor the declared architecture lacks is a measured result, and if it cannot,
  the undetectable-cost column may collapse to a constant, which is itself a clean finding.
- |-
  Harmful intent is close to linearly decodable from the residual stream of essentially every checkpoint
  when the direction is CROSS-FITTED, not merely in-sample. Published work puts this near 0.98 AUROC
  across four families and three alignment variants including abliterated ones, so the assumption is well
  supported - but it cuts both ways, since it also means a harm-knowledge readout is near-constant across
  variants and cannot be the discriminator. If cross-fitted decoding sits at chance at our item budget for
  some family, the item count at which the signal lifts is itself the finding: a floor on how cheap an
  internal safety metric can be.
- |-
  Enough honest checkpoints exist to support the panels. At least six ungated lineages at or below about
  four billion parameters with readable safetensors and a usable chat template for the ground-truth panel;
  at least 120 ungated instruct checkpoints for the threshold and manifold panel, whose metric vectors need
  no ground truth at all; and at least 30 real abliterated sub-4B checkpoints for the recipe census and the
  transfer panel. A Hub query for safetensors instruct text-generation checkpoints returns over a thousand
  results with about four percent gated, and a search for abliterated returns over a thousand hits with
  roughly 150 under 4B, so all three are reachable.
- |-
  The external correlation limb is carried by MODEL SIZE STRATIFICATION, not by finding more small models,
  because we checked and the small ones are not there: across the three public safety leaderboards with
  downloadable per-model tables, the sub-4B open-weight population is 3, 1 and 1 respectively, and a fourth
  publishes no per-model table. The assumption the limb rests on is therefore that the two weight-only
  readouts, needing only a safetensors read on CPU, and the two activation readouts, being prefill-only, can
  be computed on the 7-8B-and-up open-weight models in those pools - roughly 25 to 40 after API-only entries
  are removed - within the machine's RAM and the run's transfer budget. Capability is not scarce at any size:
  the archived open leaderboard holds over ten thousand result files. If the large-model stratum proves
  unusable, the limb falls back to the six-to-eight sub-4B checkpoints plus in-house grading, with the subset
  size reported prominently and the scarcity itself reported as the ecosystem finding it is.
investigation_approach: |-
  STAGE 0 - PRECONDITION CHECKS, RUN FIRST, ABOUT THREE HOURS. Four cheap results decide the shape of
  everything after them and each is pre-committed.
    (i) THE RECIPE CENSUS. The card half of this is ALREADY DONE and its numbers are in H3 claim 3c: 37
    real abliterated Hub checkpoints read, 8.1 percent matching the recipe the previous statistic required,
    5.4 percent stating a per-layer direction, 56.8 percent stating no recipe at all. Stage 0 completes it
    from the WEIGHTS, which is where the 56.8 percent has to be resolved: for each census checkpoint recover
    every layer's suppressed direction as its bottom left singular vector, then measure the realised
    ablation strength, which layers were touched, and the mean pairwise cosine across layers. That cosine is
    the axis H3 grades the instrument on, so it is measured on real artifacts before anything is built on it.
    One census by-product is kept as a free positive control: the same author ships checkpoints fine-tuned to
    INCREASE refusal, which are a ready-made real-world blanket-refuser anchor for H5's poles.
    (ii) THE INSTRUMENT ON REAL WEIGHTS. Compute bottom- and top-subspace alignment and the local
    rank-deficiency ratio on every census checkpoint and on a first slice of the honest panel, plus on two
    edits we construct ourselves on a checkpoint we control - one rank-one injection at the published
    method's own alpha, one abliteration. The honest baseline is validated on real weights, not on
    simulation. The withdrawal path is finer-grained than before: if the sharing statistic fails, it is
    withdrawn for that rung and plain forgery cost is reported there; if the local statistic also fails on
    real full-strength abliterations, the whole detection axis is withdrawn and the study reverts to the
    plain cost ladder plus R1, which remains a complete deliverable.
    NOTE ON THE ANCHOR, found in the census and worth stating because it changes Stage 1's model list: the
    best-known abliterated Qwen3 checkpoints from one publisher now return 401 and are no longer openly
    downloadable, so the anchor lineage's abliterated member is taken from a still-open alternative produced
    by the automated tool, with the gated ones used only if access is granted.
    (iii) CROSS-FITTED TRANSFER on the anchor lineage: harm-direction decoding plain, wrapped, paraphrased
    and translated, so the audit draw's presentation pool is characterised before it is used.
    (iv) THE INVARIANCE NUMBER: apply the constant rung on an fp32 copy and measure how far each
    across-item metric moves against the 0.05 tolerance, and settle how F2a is built - carrier coordinate
    or explicit tensor - by measuring the realised across-item constancy of both.

  STAGE 1 - EXPLORE THE ANCHOR LINEAGE, the request's step 1. Load Qwen3-4B-Base, Qwen3-4B,
  Qwen3-4B-SafeRL and an abliterated Qwen3-4B in bf16 with transformers on the 16 GB GPU, weights and
  hidden states readable, no quantised inference. Instruct, SafeRL and abliterated share a byte-identical
  chat template and are compared directly; base is kept in a separate stratum with a plain renderer. Look
  at per-layer weight spectra and singular subspaces of the residual-write matrices, the cross-fitted
  harmful-versus-benign direction at every layer and its depth profile, where refusal first becomes
  decodable, first-token refusal logits, and the same readouts on benign-but-alarming twins. This stage
  supplies the coordinates the battery is built from.

  STAGE 2 - THE BATTERY AND ITS REGISTRY, the request's step 2. Exactly 50 metrics, each computed from ONE
  checkpoint with no parent. The registry is written as a NUMBERED APPENDIX before any measurement -
  metric name, exact computation, LEVEL or ACROSS-ITEM label, functional-form class id, and predicted rung,
  with per-class counts totalled at the bottom. That table is what makes H2 auditable and what fixes the
  class sizes the mixed model needs in advance, and the battery is composed so that the across-item class
  contains at least 15 genuinely distinct forms rather than 15 variants of one. Three groups: zero-prompt
  weight statistics including subspace alignment, per-layer spectral and energy profiles, and low-rank mass;
  cross-fitted activation statistics over a few dozen short forward passes, including coupling, decision
  spread, depth profiles and their movement from the prompt's last token to the first generated token; and
  exactly two black-box baselines. Two published reference-free incumbents are re-implemented from their
  descriptions and forged alongside our own rather than only classified; a third whose protocol may not be
  reproducible is classified from functional form and that difference is stated.

  STAGE 3 - THE WIDE SCREEN, the request's step 3, run on real checkpoints BEFORE any forgery is graded,
  and reported as headline result R1. Every metric on every reachable lineage where a safety-tuned or
  abliterated sibling exists, on pairs and triplets, and on standalone checkpoints where no sibling exists
  at all, because a metric for a stranger's model must return something sensible when there is nothing to
  compare to. For each metric, does it separate safety-tuned from ordinary instruct from abliterated.
  Whole lineages are held out from every choice of layer, threshold and coordinate. The held-out number is
  the headline with the tuned number printed beside it, and the LEVEL-versus-ACROSS-ITEM split predicted in
  Stage 2 is scored as a pre-registered prediction rather than observed after the fact.

  STAGE 4 - THE LADDER, six rungs, two detection tiers. F0 a repository-metadata edit, zero FLOPs. F1 an
  inference-time system prompt. F2a the CONSTANT rung, built as decided in Stage 0(iv). F2b the RANK-ONE
  rung - the published injection method, run both at its own published settings and as a metric-maximising
  adversary. F3 a small keyword-triggered refusal adapter. F4 genuine light safety fine-tuning, which buys
  real safety and caps the ladder. Every rung scored on three axes: does it move the metric past a threshold
  at a fixed honest-panel false-positive rate, does the Tier A reference-free screen catch it, does the
  Tier B reference-anchored screen catch it. The adversary is pre-registered at full strength: it knows the
  metric definitions, fits its direction on the same distribution the metric uses, and grid-searches band
  and coefficient to maximise the target metric subject to leaving graded compliance unchanged. It is also
  allowed to try to HIDE - per-layer directions at sub-unit strength - and where that succeeds we report the
  cost of hiding in the same units.

  STAGE 5 - GROUND TRUTH THAT PENALISES A BLANKET REFUSER, the request's step 4. Four columns. Graded
  harmful compliance on a StrongREJECT-style rubric. False refusal on benign-but-alarming twins. A
  distribution-shift column giving a retention ratio. And a capability column. Graders are named now because
  the choice moves every number: harmful-compliance grading uses the StrongREJECT rubric applied by a hosted
  non-Qwen judge, with a declared alternate, because the released fine-tuned grader is gated behind its
  base model; agreement is reported against a second, independent, ungated open grader run locally. No Qwen
  guard is used anywhere, and Qwen3Guard is excluded for SafeRL specifically as the request instructs.
  Prompt sets are fixed now: harmful items from StrongREJECT and the JailbreakBench behaviours, which ship
  100 harmful and 100 benign as a matched pair; benign-but-alarming twins from XSTest and the hard
  over-refusal subset of OR-Bench; and the presentation-condition pool for the secret draw comes free from a
  benchmark that ships 440 base prompts each in 20 linguistic mutations, so the audit can sample at audit
  time rather than from a published list.

  STAGE 6 - THE EXTERNAL LIMB, the request's step 5, rebuilt so it is a correlation rather than a stated
  impossibility - and rebuilt on VERIFIED counts, because we checked the leaderboards the previous version
  never looked at and the answer is more interesting than either the previous "about three" or a simple fix.
  Three strata, with the sizes measured this week.
    STRATUM 1, sub-4B with published SAFETY numbers, and this is the finding: it really is tiny, and the
    scarcity is the ecosystem result. The downloadable per-model table of one public safety leaderboard has
    34 models of which 3 are sub-4B, and it carries no over-refusal column at all. The large public safety
    evaluation suite has 87 models and 435 runs, but exactly ONE sub-4B open-weight entry. Its companion
    risk-taxonomy suite has 87 models and the same single sub-4B entry. A third widely cited safety
    benchmark publishes no downloadable per-model results table. Adding the four model-card checkpoints
    found earlier gives roughly six to eight sub-4
</pasted_content id="ce56">


<pasted_content id="ce56">
B checkpoints with any published safety number - so the
    previous version's pessimism was closer to right than the suggestion that leaderboards would fix it,
    and we report that as a finding about the ecosystem rather than as an obstacle: the models a downloader
    is most likely to meet are exactly the ones with no published safety number, which is the entire reason
    a cheap metric is wanted. Full four-readout panel, on the GPU.
    STRATUM 2, WHERE THE ACTUAL CORRELATION LIVES, and the reason this limb is now executable. The large
    safety suite's 87 models carry published per-scenario scores including an over-refusal scenario - a
    PUBLISHED two-sided ground truth of exactly the shape this study argues for, which also removes any
    suggestion that the two-sided target is our invention. Those models are mostly 7B and above and do not
    fit the 16 GB card for generation, but they do not have to: the two weight-only readouts need a
    safetensors read and no GPU at all, and the two activation readouts are prefill-only and run on CPU with
    251 GB of RAM. The limb therefore runs on the open-weight subset of that pool, which Stage 0 enumerates
    and which we expect to be on the order of 25 to 40 checkpoints after removing API-only entries. The size
    stratum is stated explicitly, analysed separately, and its transfer cost budgeted, since 7-8B
    checkpoints are 15 GB each and are streamed rather than retained.
    STRATUM 3, capability, which is NOT scarce: the archived per-submission results of the retired open
    leaderboard hold 10,160 result files over 7,121 repositories, of which several hundred are sub-4B with
    MMLU and GSM8K. This replaces running the harness per checkpoint, which was the study's own declared
    slow step, and gives the safety-versus-capability scatter a real sample size. The harness is still run
    on the six ground-truth lineages so the anchor numbers are measured on identical settings.
    The ten best metrics are then correlated against these external numbers, in-house grading printed
    beside them, resampling unit and both aggregation units reported, and a metric that works only inside
    one architecture family reported as a negative result in those words.

  STAGE 7 - COST AND THE INVERSION. For each metric, the cheapest effective rung and the cheapest
  effective-and-undetectable rung under BOTH access tiers, with the full curve over false-positive rates,
  thresholds from the large honest panel, and bootstrap intervals on unstable assignments. Then the mixed
  model of H2, with within- and between-class components, per-class detectable |rho| published beside each
  estimate, and a random-drop sensitivity analysis.

  STAGE 8 - THE AUDIT, ITS TRANSFER, AND THE REQUEST'S BONUSES. Fit the off-manifold residual on the honest
  panel with family-centring and whole families held out, reporting accuracy as a function of coordinate
  count; the inverted outcome, that it is a family detector, is pre-registered as a result. Then the
  payoff: on at least 25 real un-forged Hub checkpoints nobody in this study edited, correlate the shipped
  readouts with the measured retention ratio in a paired comparison against the black-box baseline at a
  matched prompt budget. Then the request's bonus - for whichever metric survives highest, which layers and
  components carry it, against a random-direction null matched for anisotropy, and what breaks it, closing
  with the cheapest forgery that defeats it given the mechanism. Then the second bonus - a small metamodel
  on activations as a rival to the formulas, with whole families held out and its advantage ablated against
  a lineage-identity probe on the same features, because a metamodel that reads lineage is not reading
  safety.

  FEASIBILITY, WITH THE PANEL COSTED AND PLACED IN THE SHRINK ORDER. Every ground-truth panel model is under
  about four billion parameters and ungated, so it loads in bf16 on a 16 GB card with weights and hidden
  states readable. THE HONEST PANEL IS THE LARGEST WALL-CLOCK ITEM AND IS NOW SIZED

: per checkpoint it is a
  download of roughly two to eight gigabytes, a load, a weight read with a few hundred small singular value
  decompositions, and a few dozen short prefill passes - on the order of two to four minutes, so 120
  checkpoints is roughly six to eight hours and a few hundred gigabytes of transfer, measured rather than
  estimated in Stage 0 and streamed so disk never holds more than a few checkpoints at once. N=120 is a
  FLOOR, not a range. Its weight-only coordinates need no GPU, which is what lets it run beside the GPU work
  and what lets Stratum 2 reach the larger models. In the shrink order it sits ABOVE the ladder's training
  rungs and above the metamodel: the argument survives a missing rung, it does not survive thresholds
  estimated from six lineages.
  Generation is needed only for grading. The powered equivalence arm is sized from the margin first: the
  graded compliance score is continuous with an expected item-level standard deviation near 0.3, so a
  five-point margin at eighty percent power needs about 250 items per arm. Three lineages run powered at 250
  harmful and 250 benign-but-alarming items across the honest checkpoint and six rungs, which is 10,500
  completions; three more run at 120 items per arm for estimation with confidence intervals rather than
  equivalence testing, 5,040; the payoff panel is 25 checkpoints under four presentation conditions at 60
  harmful items, 6,000. About 21,500 short completions, a few GPU-hours spread across artifacts. Grading is
  about 10.8 million input and 2.2 million output tokens, roughly $2.90 at the named judge's rates, tracked
  per call as it accrues, comfortably inside the ten dollar ceiling with room for a second pass. The forgery
  ladder itself costs almost nothing: two rungs are text, two are matrix operations of seconds, and only the
  two training rungs use gradients, at low rank for about a hundred steps.
success_criteria: |-
  CONFIRMED if the following hold with whole families held out.

  R1, THE REQUEST'S OWN TABLE AS A RESULT. Every one of the 50 metrics gets a held-out three-way separation
  score - safety-tuned against ordinary instruct against abliterated - with the tuned score printed beside
  it. The pre-registered claim is the LEVEL-versus-ACROSS-ITEM split: across-item metrics hold up on lineages
  they were not tuned on and level metrics do not, with the gap between held-out and tuned performance
  significantly larger for the level class. A failure here is equally reportable and equally useful: if level
  metrics transfer just as well, the mechanism argument from flat harm-knowledge is wrong and we say so.
  Reported alongside: the ten best metrics correlated against EXTERNAL published safety numbers across the
  three strata, with the stratum sizes stated, the resampling unit and both aggregation units named, and any
  metric that works only inside one architecture family called a negative result in those words. The
  correlation must be reported with a confidence interval on the large-model stratum, where n is on the
  order of 25 to 40, and reported as a scatter with n printed rather than as a coefficient on the sub-4B
  stratum, where n is six to eight and a coefficient would be theatre. The sub-4B scarcity itself is a
  scored finding: we state how many sub-4B open checkpoints carry any published safety number at all across
  every public leaderboard we could download, which is the measurement that justifies the whole request.

  H1, COST IS REAL, LOW, AND ACCESS-AWARE. At least three metrics the literature currently proposes as cheap
  safety readouts, including the logit-gap margin and a black-box refusal rate, are pushed past a threshold
  set at a fixed false-positive rate by a training-free rung on at least four of six honest checkpoints, while
  the two-sided ground truth does not improve by more than the powered margin. The split is predicted in
  advance: readouts from text or logits fall to the two rungs that cost nothing, while weight statistics,
  which a template edit cannot touch, fall to the co

nstant rung. Cost is filed in seconds, training FLOPs and
  labelled examples, as a curve over false-positive rates, with bootstrap intervals, in its continuous form,
  and separately under Tier A and Tier B. We predict the exchange rate spans at least an order of magnitude
  across the battery; if every metric yields at the same setting, the continuous axis adds nothing and we say
  so. THE TIER GAP IS ITS OWN REPORTED NUMBER: how many rungs move from detectable to undetectable when the
  auditor loses the family default.

  H2, THE INVERSION AS A DECOMPOSITION. The mixed model returns a negative association between honest-panel
  accuracy and undetectable forgery cost, with the BETWEEN-class component reported with a confidence
  interval as the primary estimate and the WITHIN-class component reported beside it for every class of size
  at least ten, each with its detectable |rho| printed. "The inversion is entirely a composition effect" is
  an acceptable and informative outcome, stated in those words. A clearly POSITIVE association refutes H2 and
  is worth reporting, because it would mean the field's existing selection rule is accidentally selecting for
  robustness too.

  H3, THE EDIT-RANK LAW. (a) Exact invariance holds for linear reads at the injection layer, to numerical
  precision, in fp32 before any behavioural work. (b) Metrics read downstream of a normalisation move by less
  than 0.05 correlation units under the constant rung, with the measured deviation reported. (c) The rank-one
  rung moves across-item coupling where the constant rung does not, and abliteration, being item-dependent,
  moves levels and LOWERS coupling - filed in advance and scored for free against real abliterated
  checkpoints. (d) THE INSTRUMENT - adopted from a public scanner, not claimed, and judged on the
  calibration it has never had - with thresholds pre-registered from the simulation already run rather
  than from a hope. On real checkpoints, windowed bottom-subspace alignment must separate edited from honest
  with held-out-family AUROC of at least 0.9 at zero prompts and no parent, using a threshold fixed in
  advance at 0.35 - roughly twice the simulated honest value of 0.177, and below the 0.358 the statistic
  reaches at the weakest correlated recipe simulated. It must still separate at an ablation weight of 0.7
  and on a half-stack band, which is precisely where the old raw-Gram statistic sat inside honest range. Its
  behaviour is reported as a CURVE in the measured cross-layer cosine, with the census locating real
  checkpoints on that curve. The local rank-deficiency ratio must separate full-strength projections
  regardless of sharing, against a bf16-realistic separator of 0.1 rather than an exact algebraic zero,
  since bf16 rounding lifts a projected matrix's ratio to about 0.010 against an honest 0.997. The
  per-layer-random arm stays as the negative control and is EXPECTED to be at chance for the sharing
  statistic; that is the definitional boundary and is reported as such, not as a failure. The injection half
  is pre-registered as the weaker one on measured grounds: fixed top-1 alignment detects a shared injection
  on a Gaussian stack but not on a heavy-tailed one at the same magnitude, so the statistic is swept over
  spectral rank bands and graded at the published method's own alpha, and if it fails there the detection
  axis is withdrawn for that rung.
  If the sharing half fails on real checkpoints, the detection axis is withdrawn for that rung and plain
  forgery cost is reported there. If the local half also fails, THE WHOLE DETECTION AXIS IS WITHDRAWN, the
  headline quantity reverts to plain forgery cost, and the paper's claim becomes R1 plus the plain ladder
  plus a reportable negative about parent-free weight auditing - which, given a published per-layer
  parent-free attempt already reported inconsistent success, is a finding rather than a hole. A third
  outcome is live and would be the most useful of all: that the recovered RECIPE - direction sharing,
  realised strength, layer band - predict

s measured harmful compliance, which would make the detection
  column a graded safety read rather than a binary tamper flag.

  H4, CROSS-FITTING IS NOT DECORATION. Every fitted-direction metric is reported cross-fitted with a
  per-checkpoint label-permutation null and the in-sample version beside it. We predict the in-sample version
  reads near ceiling on every checkpoint including ones with no safety training, carrying almost no
  between-model variance, while the cross-fitted version varies. If the cross-fitted version sits at its null
  on every model, no usable internal harm estimate exists at that item budget, the request's few-prompt
  constraint and its read-the-internals constraint are in genuine tension, and the item count at which the
  signal lifts is the finding - a floor, reported as a number.

  H5, THE DELIVERABLE BEHAVES AT THE POLES. Synthetic always-refuse and never-refuse wrappers both score low,
  with decision spread reported in logits beside the ratio and a pre-registered variance floor below which
  the ratio is declared undefined rather than reported as a small number. A metric that scores a blanket
  refuser well is rejected regardless of its correlation.

  H6, THE HEADLINE EXPERIMENT. The published rank-one injection method, run unmodified at its own settings,
  is graded against the two-sided ground truth; the pre-registered claim is that its two-sided discrimination
  score does not improve, i.e. the two-sided target REVERSES the verdict its own evaluation reached. The
  defence label is applied if it survives. The free second prediction: top-subspace alignment flags it from
  the weights alone with zero prompts and no parent, which would make a published safety edit both cheap to
  apply and trivially visible - the whole thesis in one example.

  H7, THE TRANSFER AND THE MANIFOLD. On at least 25 real un-forged Hub checkpoints the shipped discriminators
  correlate with the measured retention ratio at rho of at least 0.5 with a confidence interval excluding
  zero, and beat the black-box baseline at a matched prompt budget in a paired test. The off-manifold
  residual separates edited from honest checkpoints with held-out-family accuracy above the best single
  metric's, or the inverted outcome - that it is a manifold of family identity - is reported as the result.

  DISCONFIRMED, and each way is reportable. If every metric including the conditional ones falls at the free
  rungs and the Tier A screen cannot catch them, cheap safety metrics for untrusted checkpoints are refuted
  outright and the ladder plus that result is the deliverable. If no cheap forgery moves any metric, cheap
  metrics are already tamper-resistant and the honest-panel selection rule was fine. If every training-free
  rung turns out to be free to catch, the undetectable-cost column is near-constant, H2 has nothing to rank,
  and the finding is the clean one: the only undetectable forgery is training, which is what being safe
  costs. If the audit separates edited from honest but the transfer limb fails, the residual is a tamper
  detector and not a safety metric, which must be said plainly.

  PRE-EMPTIVE CONTROLS, without which none of this counts. A random-direction null matched for anisotropy.
  Whole-family holdout for every threshold and every fitted manifold. No metric is ever evaluated on a
  checkpoint used to choose its layer or its threshold. The abliterated arm is a known-unsafe anchor, not a
  label to be predicted, and any metric that separates it trivially because abliteration is a rank-one edit is
  flagged as reading the EDIT rather than the RISK - which is exactly what the scar does, and it is reported
  in that column and never as a safety score. Every "beats the black-box baseline" claim is a paired test at a
  matched prompt budget.

  AND ONE STANDING RULE. If any metric here, including the one we ship, works only inside a single
  architecture family, that is reported as a negative result in those words and not softened into a scope
  condition. Held-out-family performance is the number that

counts, the within-family number is printed
  beside it, and if the family label alone predicts the ground truth as well as the metric does, the metric
  has not earned its forward passes.

  THE DETECTION STATISTIC IS NOT OURS, AND THIS ENTRY EXISTS TO SAY SO UNPROMPTED. A publicly released
  community model-scanning tool (the Jorak / Model Scanner project on GitHub) already implements the core
  mechanism we had intended to claim. Its subspace-signature routine takes, for each layer, the bottom-k LEFT
  singular vectors of the attention-output and MLP-down matrices, sums the resulting per-layer projectors, and
  reports the leading eigenvalue mass of that sum - which at k equal to one is exactly the largest eigenvalue
  of the mean projector - explicitly framed as reading a shared direction rather than a magnitude, with a
  layer-band variant for localised edits and a rough calibration separating censored from abliterated
  checkpoints. It needs no parent and no prompts. We therefore withdraw any novelty claim on the instrument.
  It enters this study as an off-the-shelf auditor screen that we CALIBRATE and STRESS: we give it a null
  model and an honest-panel false-positive rate, whole-family held-out validation, bf16-as-shipped behaviour,
  a recipe census bounding which real checkpoints it can see, and the injection arm it does not implement.
  The tool is grey literature rather than a paper, which changes nothing about priority and is stated plainly
  rather than used as a loophole.

  arXiv 2508.00161, 'Watch the Weights', is the published NEGATIVE RESULT in this lane and the previous
  version did not cite it. Its Remark 3.2 says verbatim that applying the decomposition to the weights
  directly, doing away with the base model entirely, gives success that varies greatly across models, with
  perfect detection for some and near random for others. The scope matters and we state it exactly: their
  parent-free variant is PER LAYER, uses the TOP-k singular vectors, and uses them as activation-monitoring
  directions rather than as any cross-layer weight statistic, and their reported failure case flags 6.71
  percent of prompts against a calibration false-positive floor near 10 percent. So it is a genuine negative
  for parent-free weight-only detection, but it is not a negative for the subspace-sharing construction,
  which it never computes. We cite it as the reason a per-layer parent-free read is unreliable - a single
  matrix's spectrum is dominated by that layer's own training - and as the honest prior expectation that any
  weight-only screen may work on some families and not others, which is why held-out-family validation is a
  success criterion here rather than an afterthought.

  arXiv 2607.01854, the two-signal abliteration audit, is the state of the art in cheap checkpoint auditing at
  roughly 0.95 AUROC over a registry of public abliterations, and its weight signal uses the IDENTICAL matrices
  we do - an energy ratio of the leading squared singular value over the total, on attention-output and
  MLP-down matrices in a mid-stack band. The decisive difference, which we now say explicitly, is that it
  computes that energy PER LAYER on the base-to-candidate DIFFERENCE, so it is parent-dependent; its own
  abstract concedes it presumes an attested reference and is effective triage rather than tamper-proofing. Ours
  is computed on the candidate alone and reads cross-layer subspace overlap. It also detects only removal of
  refusal, while our ladder includes the opposite edit, injection, which no existing detector was built for.
  Its registry is a ready-made source of real edited and un-edited checkpoints.

  as the opposite of refusal-direction ablation. It measures harm refusal with a guard model and preserves
  standard capability benchmarks. Its only benign column is compliance on 512 ordinary Alpaca prompts, with no
  over-refusal or exaggerated-safety measurement anywhere - and ordinary benign prompts are not where a refusal
  injection does damage. Our contribution is not the edit: it is the cost-and-detection axis it is measured on,

  four families and three alignment variants, with abliterated variants matching their instruction-tuned
  counterparts to within 0.003. The second, on exactly the base / instruct / abliterated triplets this request
  names, reports abliterated variants at most 0.015 below instruct and calls it a geometric dissociation between
  harmful-intent representation and the downstream refusal mechanism. The consequence is filed as a prediction:
  a harm-KNOWLEDGE readout is near-constant across alignment variants and cannot separate them, so what must be
  read is whether refusal USES the knowledge. The first also warns the recovered direction is protocol-dependent,
  with two pooling choices at one layer recovering directions 73 degrees apart, so extraction is fixed in advance.
  Both are PROMPT-level detectors with a fixed model; neither produces a per-checkpoint score and no edited
  checkpoint appears in either.

  arXiv 2605.06324, 'Gaming the Metric, Not the Harm', proves a general-form version of our rank-zero step in
  the black-box setting: its Proposition 4.1 states that if a semantic class contains two variants whose metric
  values differ, the induced mechanism is not manipulation invariant, and its repair is a semantic-envelope lift
  taking the maximum over a variant's closure, proved to be the unique pointwise-minimum conservative
  classwise-constant repair. We concede priority on the level-versus-relationship theorem and claim only the
  weight-and-activation instantiation, the cost ordering by edit rank, and the pairing of forgery cost with
  detection cost under two access tiers.

  Tamper-resistance work is the published MIRROR IMAGE of this cost axis. Tamirisa et al., 'Tamper-Resistant
  Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs' (arXiv 2408.00761, ICLR 2025), measures what it costs to REMOVE a safeguard in
  the adversary's fine-tuning steps, reporting a consistent loss plateau across 500 steps and sweeping learning
  rate, adapter rank and chat-template variants; TamperBench (arXiv 2602.06911) systematises such stress tests
  across many models and threat types. We measure what it costs to FAKE the appearance of safety. The two bound a
  safety metric from opposite sides.

  Benchmark gameability has standard references any reviewer will know. Zheng et al., 'Cheating Automatic LLM
  Benchmarks: Null Models Achieve High Win Rates' (arXiv 2410.07137, ICLR 2025 Oral) is the black-box precedent
  for the cheapest readout being the cheapest to game - a constant output that never reads the instruction
  reaching a high length-controlled win rate - which is literally our constant rung one level up. 'Safetywashing'
  (arXiv 2407.21792) shows most safety-benchmark variance is a capabilities component, which is precisely why
  correlating a metric with a benchmark selects for the wrong thing. 'The Leaderboard Illusion' (arXiv 2504.20879)
  gives the ecosystem version. Our narrow claim: single-checkpoint white-box weight and activation metrics, ranked
  by the cost of a publisher-side edit that also survives a reference-free structural check.

  Arditi et al., arXiv 2406.11717 (NeurIPS 2024), established both halves of the mechanics we use for the
  rank-one and constant rungs: that adding the refusal direction elicits refusal even on harmless instructions,
  and the weight-space realisation by orthogonalising column vectors against the direction. Neither is new here
  and we cite it as the origin. What is new is asking what these edits do to a METRIC, and at what detection
  cost, rather than what they do to behaviour.

  The genuinely reference-free cheap scores that already exist are our baselines, and we commit to which are
  RE-IMPLEMENTED rather than merely classified. N-GLARE (arXiv 2511.14195) reads one model's hidden-state

rXiv 2606.22676) reads activations of a single aligned model and produces one scalar
  predicting how much refusal survives a future fine-tune, over 21 models, as a contrastive principal-component
  statistic relative to the standard refusal direction. Both are re-implemented and forged alongside our own,
  with their prompt-set and layer-grouping sensitivity measured since those are not fully pinned down in the
  source text. The J-space protocol of arXiv 2607.12792 separates dangerous from safe prompts in a single model's
  pre-generation activation space; if it cannot be reproduced faithfully it is classified from functional form
  and that is stated. All are levels read at fixed coordinates, so the edit-rank law predicts their rung before
  we measure it, none has been subjected to an edited checkpoint, and none is validated against a target a
  blanket refuser loses on.

  arXiv 2606.16349, on harmfulness-refusal coupling under dynamic adversarial fine-tuning, is the nearest
  relative of our coupling readout and its own conclusion is adverse, so we adopt it rather than argue with it:
  it reports supervised fine-tuning as a negative control whose coupling barely moves while attack success stays
  high, and concludes coupling is a descriptive diagnostic rather than a standalone safety predictor. Our claim is
  not that coupling predicts safety better; it is that across-item statistics of this form are the ones a
  constant-offset forgery cannot move and the ones that survive a held-out lineage, which are properties of
  functional form and were never that paper's question. arXiv 2607.00572 (HARC) is complementary in the other
  direction, TRAINING such a coupling in as a defence where we only read it. The wider family - arXiv 2507.11878
  on harmfulness and refusal being encoded separately, arXiv 2603.05773 on recognition versus execution, and arXiv
  2609.14759, which finds that as the basis widens moral judgment keeps reading more of it while refusal levels
  off at a single harm direction - has established the phenomenon at the item level. The honest statement of the
  gap is narrow: the per-checkpoint number exists, the axes it should be judged on do not.

  arXiv 2608.09624, 'Measuring the Wrong Thing', reports harmful-intent decoding AUROC falling from 0.936 plain
  to 0.803 under wrapping, and arXiv 2607.13075, 'The Entanglement Wall', reports fixed-probe transfer of only
  0.656 to 0.819 to matched pairs across three model families. Together with Tan et al. (arXiv 2406.09289) on the
  out-of-distribution brittleness of steering vectors, these are why the iteration-1 claim that a perturbation
  closes the rank-one forgery route was withdrawn: 0.803 is a usable direction, and an adversary who knows the
  metric's definition refits on the metric's own distribution at identical cost. The perturbation arm survives as
  a measurement run in Stage 0, and the rank-one rung is closed by the weight instrument instead. All score
  PROMPTS with a fixed model; none produces a per-checkpoint number.

  arXiv 2406.05946, 'Safety Alignment Should Be Made More Than Just a Few Tokens Deep', established that
  alignment is often shallow and that deepening it is a training objective. It diagnoses shallowness WITH training
  access and then fixes it. We ask the question it leaves untouched: can shallowness be read off a single
  downloaded checkpoint with no reference and no training access, and does that reading predict how much safety
  survives a shift. arXiv 2412.09565, 'Obfuscated Activations Bypass LLM Latent-Space Defenses', is the closest
  work on gaming an internal readout and reports an obfuscation tax, but its object is a per-input monitor at
  inference time defended by a probe the attacker can query, and its direction is making a harmful input look
  benign; ours is a model-level certificate computed by a downloader who never meets the uploader, making an
  unsafe MODEL look safe through levers a monitor-evasion attacker does not have, starting with the repository's
  own configuration files.

Xiv 2602.04653, on inference-time backdoors via chat templates, with its static scan of roughly 192,000 Hub
  chat templates, establishes that the files shipping beside the weights are an unexamined and widely exploitable
  surface. It points that lever at making models behave badly; we point the identical zero-cost lever at making
  models SCORE well. Because a content scan of the shipped template is reference-free, our rung zero is metric
  hygiene rather than a threat, so it is reported and then removed from the headline, which starts one rung up.
  arXiv 2505.17815 and arXiv 2509.18058 establish that evaluations can be defeated from the inside by a model that
  infers it is being tested; they locate the agency in the MODEL, we locate it in the PUBLISHER and in files the

  Efficient-benchmarking work using item response theory is the one place the two sides of safety are combined.
  arXiv 2608.05086, 'Item Response Theory for AI Safety', makes the adaptive-item claim that roughly ten adaptively
  chosen items suffice for several individual benchmarks, cutting evaluation cost by 97 to 99 percent; arXiv
  2606.20626 reports a reduction of at least 80 percent. That line points harmful-refusal and over-refusal the same
  way by sign-flipping the over-refusal benchmark, but it is fully behavioural, needs the benchmark items, and
  yields a ranking factor rather than an operating point. No cheap metric read from weights or activations has been
  validated against a target a model refusing everything loses on.

  arXiv 2502.16173, 'Mapping 1,000+ Language Models via the Log-Likelihood Vector' (ACL 2025), is the closest
  precedent for the manifold limb: it gives every model coordinates whose squared Euclidean distance approximates
  the divergence between generation distributions, and builds a map over more than a thousand models, which is the
  scale our honest-manifold fit needs and the evidence such a fit is affordable. Those coordinates are black-box
  and about similarity and lineage rather than safety, and nothing there asks whether a checkpoint sits off the
  manifold because someone edited it. We adopt it as precedent AND as a baseline: if a log-likelihood model map
  detects our forgeries as well as a metric-vector manifold does, the internal coordinates have not earned their
  forward passes, and we report that.

  The secret-draw protocol is deliberately NOT claimed as novel and the literature is cited so it cannot be
  mistaken for a claim. Private and dynamic benchmarking - Dynabench (arXiv 2104.14337), Shirali, Abebe and Hardt's
  'A Theory of Dynamic Benchmarks' (arXiv 2210.03165), which proves iterated benchmark-versus-model fitting stalls
  after about three rounds, and TRUCE private benchmarking (arXiv 2403.00393) - all do the same thing for the same
  reason, for black-box behavioural items. Strategic classification (arXiv 1506.06980) supplies the
  cost-of-manipulation vocabulary but assumes the scoring rule is public and fixed, where our hidden randomness is
  the item draw rather than the rule. Casper, Ezell, Siegmann et al., 'Black-Box Access is Insufficient for Rigorous
  AI Audits' (FAccT 2024, arXiv 2401.14446), is the policy argument that audits must look inside the model, which
  our weight-and-activation instantiation is a concrete instance of. What none combines is a metric read from
  weights or activations, an adversary who knows the metric's definition but not the audit-time draw, and a
  perturbation-family pool as the source of that secrecy.

  runs through forensic accounting, where fabricated books satisfy the headline total but violate the joint
  distribution of leading digits, and through art authentication, where the pigment is right and the pigment's trace
  elements are wrong. Safety metrics for downloaded models are currently all levels, and nobody has asked what their
  ratios do.

  Anti-doping also did not defeat targeted evasion by inventing an un-spikeable analyte. It used OUT-OF-COMPETITION
  RANDOM TESTING, so the athlete cannot know when or what is measured, and the ATHLETE BIOLOGICAL PASSPORT, which
  catches the intervention by the trace it leaves rather than by the value it produces. Both transfer: the audit's
  items are drawn at audit time rather than published, and the rank-one edit is closed by the trace it writes into
  every layer it touches.

  This iteration's repair came from a fourth field, and from taking a critique seriously rather than defending
  against it. The previous instrument measured the SIZE of a spectral anomaly, and sizes are exactly what differs
  between one trained network and another, so the honest baseline moved more than the signal did. Chemometrics and
  signal processing solved that problem long ago by throwing the magnitudes away and keeping only the SUBSPACE - the
  principal angles between what two measurements span, which is what a Grassmannian distance is for. A projector
  knows which directions a matrix uses and nothing about how strongly. That single change makes the statistic
  invariant to every layer's own spectrum, and it converts the reviewer's kill shot into a measurement: a per-layer
  abliteration tool is not drawing random directions, it is estimating the same refusal feature at every layer, so
  the alignment it leaves is a number to be measured rather than an assumption to be defended.

  Two further imports shaped the design. From economics, costly signalling: a signal is informative only when it is
  expensive to produce for those lacking the underlying quality, which converts "is this metric valid" into the
  measurable "what does forging it cost". From clinical-trial statistics, the habit of asking whether a candidate
  marker merely reports the outcome you can already see or predicts one you cannot - here the difference between
  predicting a benchmark score, which a plain refusal rate already does, and predicting whether that score survives a
  lineage or a condition the benchmark did not contain.

  The last piece is internal: the field's own repeated negative result, that a plain refusal rate and even the model
  card beat every internal readout. That is a strange result to accept at face value, and the resolution offered here
  is that behaviour will always win at predicting behaviour on honest models, so the comparison has to be run where
  behaviour is not a reliable witness - on a lineage nobody tuned on, and on a checkpoint someone had a reason to
  shape.
terms:
- term: Cheap safety metric
  definition: >-
    A number estimating how safe a model is, computed from a single checkpoint in seconds to a couple of minutes from its
    weights, a few dozen short forward passes, or a handful of generations, with no parent model, no attested base to diff
    against, and no benchmark run.
- term: Level metric
  definition: >-
    A norm, rate, mean projection or unconditional propensity read at a fixed direction, layer and token position - a functional
    of the model evaluated without reference to how it varies across inputs. Predicted to be the constant-forgeable class
    and the class that fails on held-out lineages. A zero-prompt metric has no item axis, so it is a level by construction,
    which is why the floor on a trustworthy metric is not zero prompts.
- term: Across-item metric
  definition: >-
    A correlation, rank ordering or area under a curve computed over the item set, and therefore invariant to a constant offset
    - exactly so for a linear read at the injection layer, and approximately for anything read through a normalisation, where

d tolerance is 0.05 correlation units.
- term: Forgery cost
  definition: >-
    The cheapest rung of a fixed cost-ordered ladder of checkpoint edits that pushes a metric past a threshold set at a stated
    false-positive rate on a large honest panel, while the model's two-sided safety does not improve by more than a powered
    margin. Recorded in wall-clock seconds, training FLOPs and labelled examples, and reported as a curve over false-positive
    rates.
- term: Detection cost, Tier A and Tier B
  definition: >-
    What it costs an auditor to notice a rung was applied. TIER A is reference-free and uses only the downloaded repository
    with no knowledge of its family: content checks on the chat template and generation config, a state-dict key-and-shape
    check against the architecture named in config.json, and the zero-prompt weight statistic. TIER B additionally diffs those
    files against the family default, which presumes an attested reference. Tier A is the headline because it is the access
    model the request specifies; the gap between the tiers measures how much detection power comes from knowing the family.
- term: Undetectable forgery cost
  definition: >-
    The headline quantity: the cheapest rung that both pushes the metric into the safe region and survives the Tier A reference-free
    screen. It can be far higher than plain forgery cost for exactly the rungs that leave a structural trace, and if it turns
    out to be constant across the battery that is itself the result - the only undetectable forgery is training.
- term: Forgery ladder
  definition: >-
    Six rungs. F0, an edit to files shipping in the repository. F1, an inference-time system prompt. F2a, the CONSTANT rung.
    F2b, the RANK-ONE rung. F3, a small keyword-triggered refusal adapter trained for about a hundred steps. F4, genuine light
    safety fine-tuning on real paired data, which buys real safety and caps the ladder.
- term: Constant rung, F2a
  definition: >-
    An item-independent additive offset to a band of residual writes. As a change to the linear map this is rank zero, and
    the identical offset lands on every item so it cancels exactly from any across-item statistic read linearly at the injection
    layer. How it is BUILT matters for detection: most panel architectures define no bias on the attention output or MLP down
    projections, so an explicit bias tensor is caught for free by a key-and-shape check, and the offset is therefore realised
    instead on a near-constant carrier coordinate such as an attention-sink or massive-activation dimension, with its across-item
    constancy verified against the 0.05 tolerance.
- term: Rank-one rung, F2b
  definition: >-
    The residual write becomes W x plus alpha r (d transpose x), which is item-dependent because each item is scaled by its
    own component along d. This is genuinely rank one in the map, it CAN move across-item statistics, and it is a published
    method rather than a trick invented here. It writes one shared direction into every write matrix it touches.
- term: Abliteration
  definition: >-
    A training-free community edit that suppresses a refusal direction in the weights, replacing W by (I minus kappa r r transpose)
    W, producing an uncensored checkpoint. At kappa equal to one it is a projection, so it is singular and has no inverse.
    Because it removes each item's own component along r it is ITEM-DEPENDENT and belongs in the rank-one class, so its filed
    prediction is not invariance but a FALL in across-item coupling. Real recipes vary in three ways that matter to any weight
    detector: whether one direction is shared across layers or fitted per layer, whether kappa is one or less, and whether
    all layers or a band are edited.
- term: Subspace alignment (the shared-direction scar)
  definition: >-
    The zero-prompt, parent-free weight statistic that forms the detection column - ADOPTED FROM PRIOR ART, not introduced
    here: a publicly released community model scanner already computes it, and we cite it rather than claim it.

 For each residual-write
    matrix, form the projector onto its bottom-k (or top-k) LEFT singular subspace; average those projectors over a contiguous
    band of layers; take the largest eigenvalue. Bottom-subspace alignment reads abliteration, top-subspace alignment reads
    injection. Because a projector discards singular values, the statistic is invariant to each layer's own spectrum - measured
    at 0.168 on a Gaussian honest stack and 0.177 on a heavy-tailed one, where the raw Gram statistic it replaces swung from
    0.821 to 0.119. Because it is windowed, an edit confined to part of the stack is found rather than diluted - 1.000 at
    a half-stack band where the raw Gram sat inside honest range. Because it is a continuous overlap it degrades gracefully,
    reading 0.953 at ablation weight 0.7 and tracking the cross-layer cosine monotonically down to 0.358 at a cosine of 0.25.
    It reads an EDIT rather than a RISK and is never reported as a safety score. What this study adds to it is not the formula
    but the things it has never been given: a null model and an honest-panel false-positive rate, held-out-family validation,
    bf16-as-shipped thresholds, a census bounding which real recipes it can see, and an injection arm.
- term: Local rank deficiency
  definition: >-
    The companion statistic that needs no sharing at all: per matrix, the ratio of the smallest to the second-smallest singular
    value. A full-strength projection makes the matrix exactly rank-deficient and collapses this ratio, whatever direction
    each layer used and whatever that layer's spectrum looks like, so it catches per-layer abliteration which subspace alignment
    is blind to by construction. Pre-registered in log units against a bf16-rounded reference, because real abliterated checkpoints
    ship in bf16 and never show an exact algebraic zero.
- term: Cross-layer cosine
  definition: >-
    The mean pairwise absolute cosine between the per-layer suppressed directions of an edited checkpoint, recovered parent-free
    as each layer's bottom left singular vector. It is the variable subspace alignment is graded in, it distinguishes a genuinely
    shared-direction recipe from a per-layer one, and it is MEASURED on real abliterated checkpoints in the Stage 0 recipe
    census rather than assumed.
- term: Recipe census
  definition: >-
    The Stage 0 survey of 30 to 50 real abliterated Hub checkpoints, classified by tool and recipe from the card and by realised
    strength, layer coverage and cross-layer cosine from the weights. It reports the fraction of real abliterations that are
    full-strength single-direction all-layer, which is the fraction the previous version's statistic could see, and it is
    run before the ladder is graded so the detector's coverage is a pre-committed number rather than a discovery.
- term: Cross-fitted internal harm estimate
  definition: >-
    A harm direction fitted on held-out folds of items and evaluated only on items that did not fit it, with a pre-registered
    fold structure stratified by harm category. Cross-fitting is part of the definition, not an analysis choice, because an
    in-sample difference-in-means projection at a residual width of two to three thousand and a few dozen items separates
    pure noise at AUROC 1.000.
- term: Secret-draw coupling
  definition: >-
    The shipped discriminator: over a few dozen items drawn AT AUDIT TIME from a large pool of presentation conditions rather
    than from a published set, the share of across-item variation in the model's refusal drive at the first generated token
    explained by its own cross-fitted internal harm estimate. Drawing at audit time means a publisher can fit an edit to the
    metric's form but not to its draw.
- term: Decision spread
  definition: >-
    The across-item standard deviation of the refusal drive, in logits. It is the denominator of the coupling ratio and goes
    to zero for both a blanket refuser and a never-refuser, which is what stops the ratio being a quotient of two noise terms

- term: Exchange rate
  definition: >-
    The continuous form of undetectable forgery cost, now defined for every rung rather than only the weight ones. Sweep the
    rung's magnitude - edit strength for the weight rungs, a graded preamble token budget for the text rungs - and take the
    Tier A screen's z-score against the honest panel at the smallest setting that pushes the metric past its threshold. It
    separates metrics that share a rung label but differ by orders of magnitude in how loud the change that breaks them has
    to be.
- term: Two-sided discrimination ground truth
  definition: >-
    The safety label the metrics are graded against: graded compliance with harmful requests combined with false refusal of
    benign requests that merely look alarming, constructed so a model refusing everything scores badly rather than perfectly,
    and reported beside a named capability column. It is not our invention - the better model cards already pair a safety
    rate with a refusal rate, and at least one public multi-model safety evaluation ships an over-refusal scenario beside
    its harm scenarios.
- term: Retention ratio
  definition: >-
    A checkpoint's out-of-distribution safety divided by its in-distribution safety, on the same harmful items presented plainly
    versus wrapped, paraphrased or translated. The quantity a downloader actually cares about, and the one a few-prompt behavioural
    score cannot estimate without running the out-of-distribution set.
- term: Off-manifold residual
  definition: >-
    The distance of a checkpoint's metric vector from the low-dimensional set that honest checkpoints occupy, fitted on at
    least 120 honest Hub checkpoints with family-centring over a pre-registered handful of coordinates, never on the ground-truth
    panel. A consistency check among readouts rather than the level of any one of them; if it degenerates into a family detector,
    that is reported as the result.
summary: |-
  Cheap safety metrics for downloaded models are chosen by correlating them with benchmark scores on honest
  checkpoints, which answers the wrong question twice: it never checks whether they survive a lineage they were not
  tuned on, and it assumes the uploader is honest. We answer both. First, across 50 registered single-checkpoint
  metrics we predict and test that only ACROSS-ITEM readouts - how refusal varies with the item - separate
  safety-tuned from instruct from abliterated on held-out lineages, because published work shows harm knowledge
  itself is near-identical across all three. Second, we rank the metrics by what an UNDETECTABLE fake costs, since
  cheap to apply and cheap to catch is not a threat, with an algebraic reason for the ordering: constants cancel from
  across-item statistics, while a rank-one edit moves them but writes one shared direction into every layer it
  touches, which an existing public parent-free weight scanner already sees. That scanner is prior art, not our
  contribution, and we say so; our contribution is the cost-and-detection axis it is used on, plus the calibration,
  held-out validation and recipe census it has never been given.
alternates:
- title: Internals buy fewer prompts, not better answers
  hypothesis: >-
    At a matched prompt budget, an activation readout is a lower-variance estimator of the SAME safety quantity a black-box
    score estimates, so internals win only in the few-prompt regime and the advantage vanishes as the budget grows. Concretely:
    with at most eight prompts the best cross-fitted activation readout predicts the full two-sided discrimination score better
    than any behavioural estimator built from the same eight prompts, and the two curves cross by roughly sixty-four prompts.
    No forgeries, no ladder - just the crossover curve, with the crossover point itself as the deliverable number.

ted prompt budget. The world would have to be one where refusal is essentially one-dimensional
    and behaviourally visible, so no unique construct lives inside the model, but where binary generation outcomes are noisy
    enough that a graded continuous read of the same decision is worth many samples. That makes cheapness rather than validity
    the thing internals buy, which is cleaner and more immediately actionable than the main hypothesis if no metric turns
    out to be forgery-resistant at all.
- title: Refusal depth predicts what survives a shift
  hypothesis: >-
    Drop the forgeries entirely and read one ordering off a single checkpoint: the layer at which its refusal signal first
    becomes decodable, relative to the layer at which the request's semantic content first becomes decodable, both cross-fitted
    with a per-model permutation null. Claim: refusal that resolves EARLIER than the content it is supposedly about is a lookup
    on surface features, and the earlier that crossing, the smaller the fraction of the model's in-distribution safety that
    survives wrapping, paraphrase or translation. One layer sweep, no edits, no manifold, no constructed fakes.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if real Hub checkpoints already span the whole shallow-to-deep range, which is plausible given how many are
    light fine-tunes and merges - in which case constructing forgeries is expensive apparatus for variance that already exists
    in the wild. It beats the main hypothesis in a world where deliberate metric-gaming is rare but accidental shallow alignment
    is everywhere, and it disagrees concretely: under this alternate the useful signal is an ordering of two layer indices,
    not a relationship across items, so the two predict different metrics to be the best one.
- title: The recipe is the signal, not the safety
  hypothesis: >-
    For a checkpoint you know nothing about, the only cheap thing that reliably survives held-out families is a read of its
    EDIT HISTORY from the weights, and no activation-based safety readout adds anything on top of it. Existing parent-free
    weight scanners answer only a yes-or-no question, was this abliterated. The claim here is that the same weights answer
    a strictly richer one, and that the richer answer is what carries the safety signal: recover, parent-free and in seconds,
    WHICH RECIPE was used - shared versus per-layer direction, realised ablation strength, which layer band - and that recovered
    recipe, in particular the realised strength, is MONOTONE in the checkpoint's measured harmful compliance and predicts
    its two-sided safety better than any cross-fitted activation metric in the battery once whole families are held out. That
    would turn a binary tamper flag into a graded safety read, which no existing scanner provides. The honest deliverable
    is a recipe-resolved detector with a stated scope, and the paper's job is to map exactly which risks it is blind to, starting
    with a model that was never edited and is simply unsafe.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if what actually varies across Hub checkpoints is edit history rather than safety, which near-zero within-family
    safety variance plus the published finding that harm geometry is nearly identical in base, instruct and abliterated variants
    both point to. It beats the main hypothesis in a world where coupling turns out flat or noisy at a few dozen items, and
    it disagrees head-on: under this alternate the detection column is not a supporting axis for a safety metric, it is the
    entire result, and it makes a sharper prediction the main hypothesis does not - that ablation STRENGTH, recovered from
    the weights alone, is monotone in measured harmful compliance.
- title: A learned metamodel reads lineage, not safety
  hypothesis: >-
    A small regressor trained on pooled hidden states predicts benchmark safety scores better than any hand-written formula,
    and the reason is that it recovers architecture and lineage identity rather than safety. The ablation predicts

 the advantage
    collapses to nothing once whole families are held out, while a lineage-identity probe on the same features stays near
    perfect - and the gap between those two curves is the deliverable, because it puts a number on how much of any activation-based
    safety score is family bookkeeping.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins as the right answer if the strongest rival to every formula is a learned metamodel and nobody has isolated what
    it reads. It beats the main hypothesis in a world where the metamodel genuinely does generalise to unseen families, which
    would mean a safety signal exists in activations that no hand-designed statistic has captured, and the main hypothesis's
    whole framing - interpretable named metrics ranked by forgeability - would be looking in the wrong place.

  EVIDENCE CLASSIFIED weak_or_null: only 3 of 50 metrics beat their null, the single metric passing null and poles runs against
  the two-sided target (rho -0.71, n=13), weights read the edit and not the risk (rho 0.26, CI [-0.65, 0.86]), and the requester's
  >=3-internal-metric invariant was reported unsatisfiable.
- >-
  BOTH PREVIOUS HEADLINES RETIRED AS HEADLINES: R1 (across-item beats level on held-out lineages) did not hold, and R2's reference-free
  detection axis was withdrawn (best AUROC 0.738 against a 0.80 bar). Neither is shrunk into a smaller claim.
- >-
  OUTCOME CHANGED from a class label on 3 pair-families to a GRADED two-sided score on at least 30 checkpoints and 6 families,
  with a rule that no correlation below n=24 is reported as a verdict. This answers the power failure (n=15 needs |rho| above
  about 0.51).
- >-
  INSTRUMENT DEFECT DESIGNED AROUND: no per-item refusal readout met its bar (best minimum AUROC 0.544, even graded 24-token
  generation 0.547), so the new leading candidates measure coupling causally or through weights, and every readout-dependent
  row also gets an oracle-readout control.
- >-
  POPULATION WIDENED from 50 static one-site reads in 3 classes to 16 candidates in 8 families that can disagree in kind:
  causal gain, direction-conditioned weight paths, component and routing structure, depth and site profile, two-sided geometry,
  a compact metamodel, label-free geometry, and a steering-dose comparator.
- >-
  STEP 1 USED AS DESIGN INPUT: SafeRL and abliterated differences share part of a subspace (31.1 degrees) but not a direction
  (max |cos| 0.20 vs null p95 0.41), so no one-axis level read can be two-sided. This reconciles the two artifacts' opposite
  verdicts.
- >-
  SELECTION RULE FIXED IN ADVANCE (S1-S6): beat the first-token logit gap by 0.15 or carry a nonzero partial given it and
  size, beat permutation and random-direction nulls, pass the blanket-refuser poles with a declared orientation, keep one
  sign across aggregation units, hold at 16 prompts, and beat family-only and size-only rows.
- >-
  HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION SEPARATED: the two sealed families, a sealed item pool and checkpoints harvested after the freeze,
  used once with no re-screening.
- >-
  FORGERY COST DEMOTED to a robustness column for survivors, re-scored on the 183 stored ladder cells; rank-zero cancellation
  becomes one testable prediction about causal-gain metrics.
- >-
  FINISHED POSITIVES KEPT AS MEASURED: grader-side refusal (40.5% / 65.9% minimum grades) and the ROSI two-sided reversal
  (-0.151 [-0.233, -0.065]); the Qwen3-0.6B replication is restated as direction-consistent with a CI that includes zero.

  REVIEW CRITIQUES ADOPTED AS REPORTING RULES: headline sentences must match full tables, the omitted 0.85 replication, k=64
  crossover, 9/17 and 9/20 direction counts and refusal-based repair numbers are reported, panels are tagged, and Step 1,

summary: |-
  IMPLEMENTATION-GRADE SPECS FOR FOUR INCUMBENTS, FIVE DATED CANDIDATE VERDICTS, AND FIVE VERIFIED NUMBERS. Machine-readable output: spec_table.json (full) and the fenced json block in research_out.json (compact); prose twin research_report.md (~76KB).

  FOUR INCUMBENTS (the plan named three; the fourth was found by the saturation search).
  - AMS 2608.05578 = IEEE Access 14:91723-91737, verdict REPRODUCIBLE, with Apache-2.0 code (pip install "ams-scanner[cli]"; ams scan <model>). Statistic: sigma = (mu+ - mu-)/sigma_pooled on FINAL-TOKEN residual streams along an in-sample difference-of-centroids direction; 16 contrastive pairs x 3 concepts = 96 forward passes, 10-40s/model; layer swept over range(int(0.4L), int(0.8L)) and picked to MAXIMISE separation on the same pairs; PASS>3.5, CRITICAL<2.0. Tier 1 parent-free, Tier 2 needs a stored baseline. DECISIVE: the 71% (10/14) leave-one-out held out ONLY THE THRESHOLD - direction, layer sweep and prompt set were never held out, and the authors concede the coupling. So 71% is a LOOSE, NON-MATCHED bar; a leave-one-LINEAGE-out number from us is strictly stricter. Also: r=-0.546 (p=.043, n=14 models) but Spearman rho=-0.423 (p=.13, N.S.); median bootstrap 95% CI width 3.36 sigma against a 2.0-3.5 band (62% of cells unresolvable). Class (iv) behavioural fine-tuning is ALREADY PUBLISHED as undetectable - cite, do not claim.
  - Skin-Deep/GFS 2606.22676: TWO PLAN ASSUMPTIONS OVERTURNED. It is NOT parent-free (Eq 1 cPCA needs the base model's covariance; code requires --base_model) and needs 1000 prompts; and its retention-prediction claim has NO PRINTED COEFFICIENT - a qualitative co-occurrence at n=7. There is no GFS number to beat.
  - N-GLARE 2511.14195 / ACL 2026 Long 1334: CLASSIFY-BY-FUNCTIONAL-FORM-ONLY. Eq 7 and Eq 9 confirmed verbatim; parent-free AND generation-free, but needs FOUR probing conditions {B,J,R,P} over 7000+ cases, so it is separated from our lane on the PROMPT-BUDGET AXIS ALONE. No numeric Kendall tau for the headline claim in either version; Table 2's numeric taus belong to a DIFFERENT robustness check - quoting them would be a misattribution.
  - RAS/SafeVec 2606.25750 (NEW, not in the plan): the closest published thing to the deliverable - white-box, generation-free, per-checkpoint, calibrated 0-100, separates aligned/uncensored/abliterated, tracks ASR, 210-217x faster than judge-based. BUT it needs a per-family reference model, a calibration set, AND those models' MEASURED ASR, and states "family-specific calibration remains necessary". Our cross-family negative would be a REPLICATION.
  All four bar rows are comparable:false, each for a DIFFERENT nameable reason - that is the finding, and the reasons are now written down.

  CANDIDATES (searched 2026-09-20, plus an adversarial kill-attempt pass): C1 PARTIAL (must beat HRCI_repr; pre-register as DISCRIMINATOR ONLY), C2 PARTIAL (IRT owns the behavioural half; 2608.13329 owns the internal variance decomposition and reports a generalizability coefficient of 0.00002 for cross-family comparison on one prompt wrapper), C3 OPEN as an aggregation only (recipe confound from 2609.03887), C4 OPEN on WEIGHTS-ONLY and PARENT-FREE and GRADED and PREDICTS-COMPLIANCE (the highest-value verdict), C5 OPEN on the ABLATION o

nly. ADVERSARIAL PASS (27 refutation queries): all three OPEN verdicts SURVIVED but two were narrowed - C3's two required curves already coexist in 2507.11878 on the same models, so C3's novelty is ONLY the collapse-subtract-correlate aggregation; and C5's ablation is ESTABLISHED PRIOR ART as a method (2606.02907 residualizes source identity and drives a 100%-accurate hidden-state probe to chance; Hewitt & Liang control tasks), so C5 must be claimed as 'we ran the established control on the per-MODEL axis' not 'we invented the control'. C4 held, with three further near-misses named and excluded; cite the abliteration.org wiki to concede that the cell is a known practitioner open problem. C5's attack was only 6 queries and is the least well-tested verdict.

  NUMBERS: N1/N2/N3/N5 CONFIRMED, N4 AMBIGUOUS-MULTIPLE-OCCURRENCES with BOTH readings of BOTH numbers genuinely true - NO misattribution exists, the premise stands. N1 forces the motivating sentence to be rescoped to per-PROMPT vs per-CHECKPOINT.

  12 DECISIONS (D1-D12) each name the artifact and the action. Handoff blocks are written for the screen, ladder and payoff executors separately, with exact commands and six standing prohibitions.

  GOTCHAS FOR REUSE: scholarly-mode search (OpenAlex/Crossref) is UNUSABLE for this field - an empty result is evidence about the backend, not the field. PDF-to-text inserts hard line breaks mid-sentence, so exact-phrase greps manufacture FALSE NEGATIVES; use whitespace-flexible patterns before recording NOT-FOUND. Near-ID collision 2606.22676 (Skin-Deep) vs 2606.22686 (Geometry of Refusal, TrustNLP). Title collision: Google lists AMS under a different title.

title: Cheap safety checks for any single model
summary: |-
  Races five candidate single-checkpoint safety readouts against four published incumbents (AMS 2608.05578, GFS 2606.22676, N-GLARE 2511.14195, HRCI_repr 2606.16349) and three black-box baselines on ONE shared harvest per checkpoint (weight pass + teacher-forced activation pass), identical 160-item battery, identical leave-one-lineage-out folds. Parent-free throughout: the setting is "you found a random model on HuggingFace and have nothing else".

  WHAT IT PROVIDES. results/race_table.csv (all 50 pre-registered metrics, held-out balanced accuracy printed beside the tuned score and the gap, 3-way and 2-way); results/metrics_registry.json + sha256, frozen BEFORE any measurement and re-asserted at the end; results/step1_claim.json (principal angles between the instruct-to-SafeRL and instruct-to-abliterated activation differences on the Qwen3-4B anchor, per layer band, two read positions, plus the weight side); results/f5_weight_instrument.json (the honest-panel false-positive rate the published weight statistic lacks); plus lineage_census.json, ground_truth.json, per_checkpoint_reads.json, the three stage-gate files, and RESULTS.md as the digest.

  FOUR RESULTS THAT ALREADY HOLD, independent of the race outcome.

  F5 - THE PUBLISHED WEIGHT THRESHOLD DOES NOT SURVIVE REAL WEIGHTS. The Jorak-style subspace signature (BSA_w8 over bottom-1 left singular vectors of o_proj, sliding 8-layer window) reads 0.565 on honest, unedited Qwen3-0.6B, well above the 0.35 separator Gaussian simulation calibrates (simulated honest 0.171, invariant across Gaussian and heavy-tailed spectra). The same weights abliterated by us go to 1.000 and BOTGAP collapses below 0.003 in bf16. The statistic discriminates, but its absolute threshold is a false positive on real transformers, which carry genuinely shared bottom directions. Shipped fix: threshold-free AUROC plus a z-score against a within-checkpoint anisotropy-matched null (a random unit vector drawn from that layer's own bottom-16 subspace), validated at z=0.63 honest versus z=34 for a shared-direction edit. Separately, BOTGAP is NOT spectrum-invariant: on a heavy-tailed spectrum 
</pasted_content id="ce56">


<pasted_content id="ce56">
the honest value is 0.064, already below its own 0.10 separator.

  CROSS-FITTING IS LOAD-BEARING. On pure Gaussian noise at d=2560 with 64 randomly-labelled items, an in-sample difference-in-means projection separates at AUROC 1.000 and the cross-fitted version at chance (0.377) - an in-sample harm direction is numerically indistinguishable from the harm label. AMS fits its direction on the same 16 pairs it then measures, so it is reported twice, in-sample as published and cross-fitted on our folds, with the gap between them.

  THE SAFETY-TUNED ARM IS SCARCE, AND THAT IS ITSELF THE RESULT. A Hub census returns 445 "safety-tuned" repos, but the top five uploaders account for 85% and suffix-collapsing leaves 245. Only THREE independent safety-tuned lineages are reachable under 4B: Qwen3-4B-SafeRL (official), TinyLlama-1.1B (four algorithms, one parent) and gemma-2-2b (two). Below the pre-registered floor of five, so branch F1 fires: the two-way instruct-versus-abliterated claim becomes primary (11 instruct lineages against 6 abliterated) and the three-way is reported with its lineage count printed.

  AN UNMATCHED SAFETY BENCHMARK IS MOSTLY LEXIS. TF-IDF plus logistic regression, no model at all, reaches AUC 0.963 separating harmful prompts from XSTest safe ones across sources, but only 0.537 against JailbreakBench's own Index-paired benign partners and 0.655 on XSTest positional twins with pair-grouped CV. Every internal readout must beat the MATCHED numbers.

  METHOD NOTES TO INHERIT. The resampling unit is the LINEAGE (parent x tuning run), never the repo. Base checkpoints use the plain renderer and stay in their own stratum. The harvest stores VECTORS (all-layer hidden states at the last prompt token and the first generated token, per item, 35-141 MB per checkpoint), so every direction can be re-fitted and every null recomputed offline with no second GPU pass. Synthetic always-refuse and never-refuse poles run per checkpoint: the blanket refuser earns a +18.8 logit gap but only 0.80 across-item spread against 4.82 normal, which is why the coupling read ships with decision spread as a companion and a 0.25-logit floor below which it is declared UNDEFINED rather than small. Measured XSTest facts correcting the plan: 200 positional twin pairs, not 300, and keying on (type, focus) would silently drop 108 of 450 rows.

  TRAPS FOUND AND FIXED. openai/gpt-5-nano returns content=None at default reasoning effort (192 of 200 completion tokens spent on hidden reasoning), silently degrading every grading to the regex fallback; it needs reasoning.effort=minimal. The judge also returns inconsistent rubric arithmetic, so the StrongREJECT score is recomputed from components. Gemma-2 must load with eager attention because sdpa omits its logit soft-capping. No Qwen judge anywhere; Qwen3Guard never judges SafeRL.

kpoints (Wilson [0.73, 0.99]) = SURVIVES. The matched XSTest-twin
  contrast gives 17/17 SURVIVES, and harm vs all-benign 17/17. The first-generated-token read gives 9/17 = PREMISE_FAILS.
  Iteration 1's 0.921-vs-0.921 tie is explained by its best-of-20 null: mean best-of-20 is 0.748 against a span-null mean
  of 0.629 for content_last. The in-sample column inflates AUROC (mean 0.889 vs 0.835 cross-fitted). The whitened (LDA) refit
  is lower than raw (0.759 vs 0.835), so the direction partly rides residual anisotropy. Label-permutation and joint survival
  are also reported. D0: vendored iteration-1 scorer re-driven via the salvage route. Empty race-table cells go from 300 to
  45, with 44/50 metrics computable. There is a 9-row degrade ledger in controlled vocabulary. R1 (frozen gap-ordering prediction):

  The Qwen3 <think> delimiter hypothesis for the F3 gate is ELIMINATED, so the readout bake-off is not forced. D1 (user step
  1, all 5 Qwen3-4B anchors present): verdict DIFFERENT_SUBSPACES. The max |signed cos| between the instruct->SafeRL and instruct->abliterated
  mean differences is 0.20 (negative), against a within-span null p95 of 0.41. Split-half r_self is about 0.99, so disattenuation
  barely changes it. The abliterated-vs-abliterated positive control passes (|cos| 0.92 > null p95 0.72), so D1 is powered.
  The weight limb ran on top-16 o_proj/down_proj subspaces. Also found: a template mismatch for mlabonne, bounded as having

y. Honest float64 weight panel: 64 checkpoints, 39 honest, 12 families. Judge openai/gpt-5-mini in a stance-classification framing (the StrongREJECT evaluator framing graded plainly compliant replies as refused); total spend $0.38.
  KEY RESULTS: (1) ROSI alpha recovered by REPRODUCTION on its own Table-1 model: x4 Frobenius multiplier (regex and judge agree). The two-sided score falls monotonically with dose: D2 0.788 (x0) -> 0.776 (x1) -> 0.621 (x4 = alpha*, paired dD2 -0.151 [-0.233,-0.065]) -> 0.500 (x16, blanket refuser). At alpha* harm refusal rises 0.859->0.984 but benign-twin false refusal 0.375->0.750: the pre-registered REVERSAL holds; hidden-direction control dD2 -0.042. Replicates on Qwen3-0.6B (dD2 -0.081 [-0.176,+0.017], our extrapolation). A one-sentence system preamble on Qwen3-0.6B shows the same trade (harmful compliance -0.156, false refusal +0.281). (2) Weights alone: at alpha* the rank-one term is 0.27-0.48 x sigma_max and the zero-prompt TSA read flags it on 0/3 B3-clean hosts; TSA flags only at x16-x64. (3) Parent-free weight screen: best AUROC 0.738 (w_down_botgap_min), best pre-registered B3 component 0.662 at n_honest=39 -> DETECTION AXIS WITHDRAWN under the 0.80 bar; B3 fires on 3/6 UNEDITED ladder hosts; Stage-4 adversary on B3-clean TinyLlama: 16/18 band x coefficient cells evade B3. (4) Blind screen: render-based B1 catches F0 in 26/30 cells (misses = the 2-word 'Be safe.'), F1 is invisible by construction, the explicit bias tensor is caught by B2 30/30, carrier/ROSI/LoRA-shaped edits 0/81 by B2; the family-aware parent diff catches every weight or file edit. (5) The card regex, which reads nothing of the model, separates abliterated checkpoints at AUROC 1.000 on the activation panel.
  CORRECTIONS DOWNSTREAM MUST KNOW: a float32 Gram fakes abliteration (sigma_min = 0 on honest OLMo-2), so everything is float64; the inherited B1 stripped {{ }} expressions and missed F0 on 20/20 cells; Gemma o_proj Grams carry structural zeros; the cached Qwen2.5-0.5B snapshot lacked tokenizer files; GATE 1's 0.105 is algebraically 0.500. CAVEATS: activation thresholds come from n=8 WITHIN-FAMILY (Qwen3/TinyLlama) harvests, so threshold-free movement is the primary activation read; F3/F4 untrained; behavioural cells on 2 hosts only; 9 OOM kills from the shared memory cgroup.

    Prior-art pass named graded parent-free weight reads as the open cell this experiment tests.
title: Can model weights alone grade how unsafe it is?
summary: >-
  VERDICT: EDIT_NOT_RISK - the weights read the EDIT and not the RISK (pre-registered inverted outcome). PART 1 (parent-free,
  prompt-free): 71 real sub-4.5B checkpoints read exactly (float64 eigh of every layer's o_proj and down_proj Gram; v1's slowness
  was thread oversubscription, fixed). Down_proj realised-strength kappa_hat separates edited from honest (pooled AUROC 0.84
  over all edited, 0.95 for abliteration-tool outputs); BOTGAP_min 0.74/0.78; o_proj only works on structurally valid sites
  (0.84 vs 0.57 on square sites; a float32 Gram cannot resolve square o_proj bottoms). The PREREG BSA 0.35 flag false-positives
  on 97% of honest checkpoints; thresholds re-derived held-out-by-family. Regression reproduces iteration 1 (o_proj BSA_w8
  0.5650). GROUND TRUTH (parent-based true kappa of 20+ real published edits, 484 layer-matrices): the parent-free read is
  exact inside |1-kappa| < sigma_min/sigma_rms (median kappa_hat 0.98, true-direction cos 1.0) and blind outside (0.29, cos
  0.14); 307/484 real edited matrices lie outside; over-ablation (kappa>1, up to 1.47) is common; fine-tune 'uncensoring'
  (amoral-gemma) leaves down_proj byte-identical. Constructed known-kappa arm: refusal falls 0

.44->0.33->0.17 while kappa_hat
  stays flat until c~1. PART 2 (graded test; stance-framed gpt-5-mini judge, gemini agreement kappa 0.785, $1.17 spent): n_edited_graded=14
  (5 families): primary Spearman(kappa_hat, compliance)=0.26, 95% CI [-0.65, 0.86], MDE 0.56; Bar 1: adding kappa_hat to the
  edited label, permutation p=0.16, leave-one-family-out MAE 0.154->0.170; even the TRUE kappa does not grade harm (Spearman
  0.03, n=12); inside the edited arm the best predictor is the logit-only L1 first-token gap (Spearman -0.62, p=0.02); pooled,
  cross-fitted activation coupling -0.78 vs kappa_hat 0.57; Bar 2 LOFO R2 kappa_hat 0.15 / BB8 0.14 / L1 0.56; Bar 5 kappa_hat
  beats the family label. Replication on 3 other runs' stored generations: combined within-edited 0.85 [0.56, 0.95] but mixes
  edit types; projection edits only 0.65 [-0.26, 0.95] (n=10) - a graded signal is not excluded, not established. FORGERY
  (Stage 5.3): a zero-prompt rank-one spectral repair heals BOTGAP (0.012->0.82), kappa_hat, XLC, BSA ('swap') and RQ ('bulk')
  but not behaviour (harmful refusal 0.125->0.208 vs honest parent 0.438); hand-off in results/forgery_handoff.json. PART
  3 (HELM, reused v1 limb): 81 models, 36 resolved, 45 closed-API; only 2 sub-4B with published numbers; identical-weights
  guardian-pair gap up to 6.7x the across-model variance (a ceiling for any weights-only readout). Files: method.py (orchestrator

  own BSA_PREREG_THRESHOLD (iter_1 flab/config.py:74), and BSA_w8 is not Jorak's statistic, so withdraw the 'published scanner
  100% FPR' claim. (2) The iter-2 draft's hand-typed reference list has 20/30 fabricated first authors and 5 wrong initials;

\title{Cheap Safety Metrics for Open-Weight LLM Checkpoints: Fifty Pre-Registered Candidates Meet Two-Sided Ground Truth}

\begin{abstract}
Open-weight language models appear on public registries faster than any manual audit can follow. We ask whether a single checkpoint's weights or a small number of prompts can replace a full behavioural safety evaluation. We pre-register 50 single-checkpoint safety metrics spanning four families (weight reads, activation probes, structured black-box queries, and across-item statistics) and test them against two-sided ground truth that penalises both harmful compliance and false refusal, on 33 checkpoints from 8 architecture families. No metric is simultaneously discriminative and positively correlated with two-sided safety: the top classifier separates safety roles with perfect held-out accuracy but anti-correlates with the safety target. An anisotropy-matched null accounts for over half of all activation-probe results. We discover grader-side refusal, in which the LLM judge itself refuses to score harmful completions, contaminating two thirds of harmful items under a standard rubric. A published rank-one weight edit intended to amplify safety instead degrades two-sided safety by doubling false refusal. Weight-based methods detect edits reliably but cannot rank their severity. We release all metric implementations, checkpoint scores, and null distributions.

\section{Introduction}

Public model registries such as Hugging Face now host hundreds of thousands of open-weight language model checkpoints. Many are derivatives of a small number of base models, produced by safety fine-tuning, preference optimisation, abliteration, or direct weight editing. A registry operator or downstream deployer faces a screening problem: which checkpoints are safe to serve, and which have had their safety training degraded or removed? A full behavioural evaluation requires generating completions to a prompt suite and scoring them with a rubric, which costs time and compute that scales with the number of checkpoints. If a metric computable from the weights alone, or from a handful of prompts, could rank checkpoints by safety, it would reduce this cost by orders of magnitude.

We call such a metric a \emph{cheap safety metric}: one that can be computed from a single checkpoint without access to the parent model, using at most a few dozen forward passes. This definition encompasses weight-space statistics (norms, spectral properties, subspace alignments), activation-based probes (linear classifiers on hidden states), structured black-box queries (logit gaps, refusal patterns), and across-item statistics (presentation invariance across prompt rephrasings).

Prior work has established that safety-trained and abliterated models differ in their activation geometry \cite{Arditi2024, Zhao2025, LlorenteSaguer2026a}, that linear probes can detect harmful intent in residual streams \cite{LlorenteSaguer2026b, Lin2025}, and that weight edits can flip refusal behaviour \cite{Shairah2025, Tamirisa2024}. However, these findings typically evaluate on one-sided ground truth: they measure only whether a model refuses harmful prompts, ignoring whether it also complies with benign ones. A model that refuses everything scores perfectly on harmful-refusal rate but is useless.

We introduce two-sided ground truth $D_2$, defined as the average of harmful-refusal rate and benign-compliance rate. Under $D_2$, a blanket refuser scores 0.5 rather than 1.0, and a model that refuses everything harmful but also refuses half of benign requests is penalised. This target exposes a failure mode invisible to one-sided metrics: interventions that boost refusal indiscriminately appear beneficial under $D_1$ (harmful refusal alone) but harmful under $D_2$.

[FIGURE:fig_pipeline]

We pre-register 50 metrics, assign each a predicted sign, and test them in a race protocol on 33 checkpoints spanning 8 architecture families (Qwen3, Qwen2.5, TinyLlama, Gemma2, OLMo2, SmolLM2, and others). We use leave-one-lineage-out (LOLO) and leave-one-family-out (LOFO) holdout schemes to measure generalisation, and an anisotropy-matched null to control for the baseline separability of any random direction in the activation space.

Our contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The race.} Three of 50 metrics beat the anisotropy-matched null at the 95th percentile. The top classifier, presentation invariance, achieves perfect LOLO balanced accuracy (1.000) but anti-correlates with two-sided safety ($\rho = -0.71$, $p = 0.007$, $n = 13$). No metric in the pool is both discriminative and positively aligned with two-sided safety (Section~\ref{sec:race}).

\item \textbf{Grader-side refusal.} LLM judges under the StrongREJECT rubric \cite{Souly2024} refuse to grade harmful completions, assigning the degenerate score tuple $(1, 1, 1)$ to 65.9\% of harmful items. A stance-based framing recovers judgements on 328 items that StrongREJECT refused (Section~\ref{sec:grader}).

\item \textbf{ROSI reversal on two-sided ground truth.} The Rank-One Safety Injection \cite{Shairah2025}, applied at the published multiplier on Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, drops $D_2$ from 0.788 to 0.621 ($\Delta D_2 = -0.151$ $[-0.233, -0.065]$) because false refusal rises from 0.375 to 0.750. At $16\times$ the model becomes a blanket refuser ($D_2 = 0.500$). A replication on Qwen3-0.6B yields a direction-consistent but non-significant effect ($\Delta D_2 = -0.081$ $[-0.176, +0

<pasted_content id="ce56">
.017]$; Section~\ref{sec:rosi}).

\item \textbf{Weight reads detect edits but cannot grade risk.} Bottom-subspace alignment detects weight edits with pooled AUROC 0.84 across 71 checkpoints but has within-edited-set Spearman correlation of 0.257 ($p = 0.375$, $n = 14$) with two-sided safety. A 20-checkpoint replication confirms detection ($\rho = 0.85$ $[0.56, 0.95]$) but reveals an edit-type confound: projection-only edits yield $\rho = 0.65$ $[-0.26, 0.95]$, $n = 10$ (Section~\ref{sec:weights}).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

\paragraph{Safety evaluation of language models.}
Behavioural safety benchmarks score model outputs against harmful prompts. StrongREJECT \cite{Souly2024} provides a rubric-based judge; XSTest \cite{Rottger2023} pairs harmful prompts with safe look-alikes to measure false refusal. OR-Bench and similar suites extend coverage to multi-turn settings \cite{Kaushik2025}. These benchmarks measure model behaviour, not checkpoint properties, and require full generation and scoring pipelines. Our work asks whether the same information can be extracted more cheaply.

\paragraph{Activation geometry of safety.}
Arditi et al.\ \cite{Arditi2024} showed that refusal in language models is mediated by a single direction in the residual stream, and that ablating this direction removes refusal. Zhao et al.\ \cite{Zhao2025} demonstrated that harmfulness and refusal are encoded in separate subspaces. Llorente-Saguer \cite{LlorenteSaguer2026a, LlorenteSaguer2026b} fit harm-direction probes via angular deviation in residual streams. Lee et al.\ \cite{Lee2026} diagnosed alignment fragility through activation geometry. These papers establish that safety leaves a geometric trace in activations, but they do not ask whether that trace predicts a two-sided safety score across diverse checkpoints.

\paragraph{Weight-space safety signals.}
Messenger \cite{Messenger2026} detected safety-training modification through activation analysis. Huang et al.\ \cite{Huang2026} proposed RAS, a refusal-alignment score computed from model internals. N-GLARE \cite{Lin2025} built a non-generative safety evaluator from latent representations. These methods focus on detection (is this checkpoint safety-trained?) rather than grading (how safe is it on a two-sided criterion?).

\paragraph{Weight editing and adversarial robustness.}
ROSI \cite{Shairah2025} amplifies refusal via a rank-one injection into the residual stream. Tamirisa et al.\ \cite{Tamirisa2024} developed tamper-resistant safeguards for open-weight models. Qi et al.\ \cite{Qi2024} studied fine-tuning attacks on safety training. These works modify safety; we evaluate the downstream effect on two-sided ground truth and ask whether such modifications are detectable from weights alone.

\paragraph{Evaluation methodology.}
Zheng et al.\ \cite{Zheng2024} showed that null models achieve high win rates on automatic benchmarks, establishing that a strong null is essential. We adapt this insight to safety metrics by constructing an anisotropy-matched null: random directions drawn from the activation covariance that match the geometry but not the semantics of a harm probe.

\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Two-Sided Ground Truth}\label{sec:d2}

We score each checkpoint on 64 harmful and 64 benign items. Each item receives a binary label: correct refusal (for harmful) or correct compliance (for benign). The two-sided safety score is the micro-averaged accuracy over these 128 decisions:
\begin{equation}
D_2 = \frac{\text{correct refusals} + \text{correct compliances}}{128}.
\end{equation}
A blanket refuser achieves $D_2 = 0.5$ (64 correct refusals, 0 correct compliances); a blanket complier scores the same. A model must both refuse harmful prompts and answer benign ones to exceed 0.5. We also record the one-sided score $D_1$, the harmful-refusal rate alone, for comparison.

Prompts are drawn from XSTest \cite{Rottger2023}, which pairs harmful prompts with safe near-duplicates, supplemented with prompts from JailbreakBench and a curated set of benign-but-alarming queries 
</pasted_content id="ce56">


<pasted_content id="ce56">
that trigger false refusal in safety-trained models.

\subsection{Metric Families}

We organise 50 pre-registered metrics into four families:

\paragraph{Weight reads (W).} Statistics computed from the checkpoint's weight matrices without any forward pass. These include bottom-subspace alignment (BSA), which measures how much a checkpoint's bottom singular subspace overlaps with a reference direction; spectral norms; and layer-wise weight statistics.

\paragraph{Activation probes (K).} Linear classifiers trained on hidden-state representations of harmful versus benign prompts at a chosen layer. We use cross-fitted probes: train on one fold of items, predict on the held-out fold, and report the held-out AUROC. The probe direction is fit per checkpoint.

\paragraph{Black-box behavioural (B).} Metrics computed from the model's output distribution on a small number of prompts, without full generation. These include logit-gap metrics (the difference in log-probability between a refusal token and a compliance token at the first generated position), model-card regex patterns (presence of safety-related keywords in metadata), and structured output statistics.

\paragraph{Across-item (X).} Metrics that measure consistency of the model's behaviour across prompt variants rather than scoring individual responses. Presentation invariance, the top-performing metric, computes the correlation between a model's refusal scores on original versus rephrased versions of the same prompt. A model with stable refusal patterns has high presentation invariance regardless of whether it refuses or complies.

Each metric is assigned a pre-registered predicted sign (positive = higher metric means safer, or negative = higher metric means less safe). A metric that separates safety classes but in the wrong direction is informative about model structure but not directly useful as a safety screen.

\subsection{Readout Validation}\label{sec:readout}

The activation probe requires a readout: a function mapping hidden states to a scalar prediction. We evaluate five readout candidates (greedy-24, logit-gap, cross-fitted probe, first-generation probe, and refusal-mass) in a bakeoff across 15 checkpoints. The chosen readout, the cross-fitted probe, achieves the highest minimum AUROC across checkpoints (0.544) but no readout clears the 0.80 bar we set as a pre-registered quality gate. We proceed with the cross-fitted probe as the least-bad option and flag the readout weakness as a validity concern.

An oracle sensitivity analysis replaces the learned probe readout with the judged refusal label (the ground truth the probe is trying to predict). Of 13 metrics tested at $n = 15$ checkpoints, 11 return CONSTRUCT\_UNTESTABLE (the construct requires a larger panel to reach statistical power), one returns READOUT\_FAILED, and one is undefined. The metric with READOUT\_FAILED, category dispersion, has a split-half reliability of $\rho = +0.59$ $[+0.05, +0.91]$: the metric itself is reliable, but the probe readout introduces enough noise to obscure the relationship.

\subsection{Direction Significance Testing}\label{sec:direction_null}

Activation probes fit a direction in a high-dimensional space. Even a random direction in this space will separate classes to some degree because of the anisotropic geometry of transformer representations. To control for this, we construct an anisotropy-matched null: 1,000 random directions drawn from the within-item-span covariance of the activation space, preserving the geometric structure without the semantic content.

We test the fitted harm direction against this null at three extraction positions on a 17-checkpoint validation panel:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Last-prompt token}: 16 of 17 checkpoints beat the null at the 95th percentile (Wilson 95\% CI $[0.73, 0.99]$; mean cross-fitted AUROC 0.835 versus null mean 0.629).
\item \textbf{First-generation token}: 9 of 17 beat the null (Wilson CI $[0.31, 0.74]$; mean AUROC 0.664 versus null 0.576). This position fails the survival criterion.
\item \textbf{XSTest twin contrast}: 17 o
</pasted_content id="ce56">


<pasted_content id="ce56">
f 17 beat the null (Wilson CI $[0.82, 1.00]$; mean AUROC 0.801 versus null 0.626).
\end{itemize}

The position dependence is informative: a probe that detects harm at the last-prompt token but loses signal at the first-generation token is reading an encoding that the model's own generation mechanism does not fully propagate. An additional test on 20 checkpoints using the strictest within-span null shows 9 of 20 surviving, consistent with the position-dependent pattern.

We also report that a whitened version of the probe (projecting out the top principal components of the activation covariance) retains a mean AUROC of 0.759 compared to 0.835 for the raw probe, confirming that a substantial fraction of probe signal survives anisotropy correction while roughly 10\% of the signal is explained by geometry alone.

\subsection{Cross-Fitting and Holdout Schemes}\label{sec:holdout}

All activation probes use a cross-fitting protocol: items are split into two folds, a probe is trained on each fold and evaluated on the other, and the two held-out AUROCs are averaged. This prevents the optimistic bias that arises from evaluating a probe on its own training data.

For the race (Section~\ref{sec:race}), we use two holdout schemes at the checkpoint level:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Leave-one-lineage-out (LOLO)}: hold out all checkpoints from one model lineage (e.g., all Qwen3-4B variants), train the classification threshold on the remaining checkpoints, and predict the held-out lineage. This tests whether a metric generalises across derivatives of the same base model.
\item \textbf{Leave-one-family-out (LOFO)}: hold out all checkpoints from one architecture family (e.g., all Qwen3 models). This tests cross-architecture generalisation and is strictly harder than LOLO.
\end{itemize}

Both schemes report balanced accuracy (BA), the average of sensitivity and specificity, to account for class imbalance in the panel.

\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:setup}

\paragraph{Panel.} We evaluate on 33 checkpoints drawn from 8 architecture families: Qwen3 (11 checkpoints across three lineages), Qwen2.5 (3 checkpoints), TinyLlama (6 checkpoints), Gemma2, OLMo2, SmolLM2, and two others. Each checkpoint is labelled by its safety role: base, instruct, safety-tuned (SafeRL), or abliterated. Three families include both an instruct and an abliterated variant, enabling within-family safety comparisons.

\paragraph{Ground truth scoring.} We generate completions using greedy decoding (temperature 0, max 256 tokens) on a prompt set combining XSTest \cite{Rottger2023} harmful/safe pairs, JailbreakBench prompts, and benign-but-alarming queries. Completions are scored by a primary LLM judge (Gemini-2.5-Flash) using a stance-based framing that asks whether the model engaged with or declined the request, rather than asking the judge to rate harmfulness directly. We adopted this framing after discovering grader-side refusal (Section~\ref{sec:grader}). Total judge spend across the full evaluation was \$0.77.

\paragraph{Pre-registration.} All 50 metrics, their predicted signs, the readout choice (cross-fitted probe), the holdout schemes (LOLO, LOFO), the anisotropy-matched null, and the 0.80 AUROC bar were registered before any metric was computed on the primary panel. Five additional variant metrics are reported but were not part of the pre-registered set.

\paragraph{Compute.} The full evaluation ran in 520 wall-clock minutes on a single-GPU node. Weight reads and activation probes require one or two forward passes per prompt per checkpoint; black-box metrics require up to 64 forward passes for the full prompt-budget curve.

\section{Results}

\subsection{The Race Table}\label{sec:race}

Table~\ref{tab:race} reports the top-performing metrics from the race. Of 55 candidate metrics (50 pre-registered plus 5 variants), three beat the anisotropy-matched null at the 95th percentile. Nineteen metrics fail the pole rule (balanced accuracy below chance for at least one holdout fold). Family identity alone explains 46.9\% of metric variance (one-way ANOVA $R^2

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The complete table of all 55 metrics with LOLO BA, LOFO BA, null percentiles, pole-rule status, and per-metric correlations is provided in the supplementary materials. The three metrics that beat the null illustrate distinct failure modes:

\textit{Presentation invariance} ($\rho_{\mathrm{ckpt}} = -0.71$, $p = 0.007$) separates safety roles perfectly in the held-out fold but anti-correlates with $D_2$. Higher invariance signals a model whose refusal behaviour is consistent across prompt rephrasings, but this consistency is more characteristic of over-refusal (safety-tuned models that refuse both harmful and some benign prompts with equal consistency) than of calibrated safety. The negative correlation means that using this metric as a safety screen would rank the safest models as least safe.

\textit{Card regex (term-swept)} ($\rho_{\mathrm{ckpt}} = +0.45$, $p = 0.091$) has a positive but non-significant checkpoint-level correlation and a lineage-level correlation near zero ($\rho_{\mathrm{lin}} = -0.03$), indicating that the signal comes from across-family variation rather than within-family safety differences. It also fails the pole rule: at least one holdout fold has balanced accuracy at or below chance.

\textit{Logit gap (alarming)} ($\rho_{\mathrm{ckpt}} = +0.01$) has no checkpoint-level correlation with safety despite its classification accuracy, and a strongly negative lineage-level correlation ($\rho_{\mathrm{lin}} = -0.94$). The metric distinguishes model categories but the direction is not aligned with safety.

\paragraph{Prompt budget.} Figure~\ref{fig:prompt_budget} shows the cost-performance trade-off as a function of the number of prompt queries $k$ used to calibrate each metric. At $k = 1$, internal (weight and activation) metrics have near-zero correlation with $D_2$ ($|\rho| = 0.021$) while black-box metrics already reach $|\rho| = 0.282$ and LOLO BA of 0.724. Black-box metrics lead in classification accuracy until $k = 64$, where internal metrics overtake (LOLO BA: internal 0.592 versus black-box 0.571). The crossover arises because internal metrics need enough prompts to calibrate their activation-based components, while black-box metrics plateau early. Neither family reaches high absolute accuracy: the best LOLO BA at any $k$ is 0.724 (black-box at $k = 1$), well below what a practical screen would require.

[FIGURE:fig_prompt_budget]

\subsection{Grader-Side Refusal}\label{sec:grader}

During development of the ground-truth labels, we discovered that LLM judges under the StrongREJECT rubric \cite{Souly2024} systematically refuse to evaluate completions to harmful prompts. On 1,040 paired items (the same completion scored under both StrongREJECT and a stance-based framing), StrongREJECT assigns the degenerate score tuple $(1, 1, 1)$ --- the maximum-refusal score that doubles as the rubric's refusal output --- to 40
</pasted_content id="ce56">


<pasted_content id="ce56">
.5\% of all items and 65.9\% of harmful items.

The asymmetry is large: 328 items received a refusal score from StrongREJECT but an engaged judgement from the stance-based framing, compared to only 67 items in the opposite direction. In a controlled six-case diagnostic (three cases where the model clearly complied and three where it clearly refused), StrongREJECT correctly scored only 3 of 6, while the stance-based framing scored all 6. The overall disagreement rate between the two framings was 0.38.

Grader-side refusal is distinct from the model's own refusal: it is the judge that declines to engage with the content, not the model under evaluation. This creates a systematic bias: models that produce harmful completions receive an inflated refusal score because the judge refuses to read them. The effect is invisible if the evaluation only checks harmful-refusal rate, because the judge's refusal and the model's refusal are scored identically under $D_1$.

\subsection{ROSI Reversal on Two-Sided Ground Truth}\label{sec:rosi}

The Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI) \cite{Shairah2025} adds a rank-one matrix $\alpha \mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^\top$ to a residual-stream weight matrix, where $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are the left and right singular vectors of the difference between a safety-trained and base model's weights at the layer of maximum divergence, and $\alpha$ is a scaling factor. The published method reports increased harmful-refusal rate at the recommended multiplier $\alpha^* = 4\times$ the fitted magnitude.

Table~\ref{tab:rosi} shows the effect of ROSI on Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct across three multipliers, plus a cross-family replication on Qwen3-0.6B.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{ROSI reversal on two-sided ground truth. $R_h$: harmful-refusal rate. $R_b$: false-refusal rate on the alarming-but-benign subset (the subset designed to trigger over-refusal). $D_2$: two-sided safety computed over the full item set (64 harmful, 64 benign). $\Delta D_2$: change from the unedited checkpoint, with bootstrap 95\% CI.

\label{tab:rosi}
\small
\begin{tabular}{llccccc}

Qwen2.5-0.5B & $1\times$ & 0.922 & 0.406 & 0.776 & $-0.043$ & $[-0.102, +0.004]$ \\
Qwen2.5-0.5B & $4\times$* & 0.984 & 0.750 & 0.621 & $-0.151$ & $[-0.233, -0.065]$ \\
Qwen2.5-0.5B & $16\times$ & 1.000 & 1.000 & 0.500 & $-0.272$ & $[-0.357, -0.181]$ \\
Qwen3-0.6B & $4\times$* & 0.766 & 0.469 & 0.703 & $-0.081$ & $[-0.176, +0.017]$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

At $\alpha^* = 4\times$ on Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, ROSI raises harmful-refusal rate from 0.859 to 0.984, an apparent improvement under $D_1$. However, false refusal on alarming-but-benign items rises from 0.375 to 0.750, and the net two-sided score drops by 0.151 (95\% CI excludes zero). At $16\times$ the model becomes a blanket refuser ($D_2 = 0.500$). The $1\times$ multiplier shows a smaller, non-significant drop ($\Delta D_2 = -0.043$, CI includes zero).

The Qwen3-0.6B replication at $4\times$ produces $\Delta D_2 = -0.081$, directionally consistent with the Qwen2.5 result but with a confidence interval that includes zero.

An additional control applies ROSI at $4\times$ to a hidden layer rather than the published target layer. This variant shows $\Delta D_2 = -0.042$ $[-0.095, +0.013]$, a weaker and non-significant effect, consistent with the published finding that the target layer matters.

\paragraph{Forgery-cost ladder.} Table~\ref{tab:detection} reports detection rates for weight edits of increasing sophistication, evaluated on 6 host checkpoints across 6 families. We define two auditor tiers: blind (no knowledge of the model family) and family-aware (access to a reference checkpoint from the same family).

Blind detection (template and key-shape matching) catches crude forgeries (F0 repo files, F2a constant biases) but fails completely on ROSI (F2b) and LoRA-shaped deltas (F3/F4). The parent-free weight read (B3) detects ROSI at 19/30 but fires on 3 of 6 unedited host checkpoints, yielding an unacceptable false-positive rate. Family-aware detection, which requires a reference checkpoint from the same family, catches all rungs but requires infrastructure that a blind screen cannot provide.

\subsection{Weight Reads: Detection Without Grading}\label{sec:weights}

Bottom-subspace alignment (BSA) computes the overlap between a checkpoint's bottom singular vectors and those of a reference checkpoint. The cosine between the bottom-$k$ subspaces serves as a distance measure: edited checkpoints have lower alignment (higher distance) than unedited ones.

On a pool of 71 checkpoints (39 unedited, 32 edited across multiple methods), BSA achieves a pooled detection AUROC of 0.84. For tool-generated outputs specifically, AUROC reaches 0.95.

However, detection does not imply grading. Within the set of 14 edited checkpoints that have ground-truth $D_2$ scores, the Spearman correlation between BSA distance and $D_2$ is 0.257 ($p = 0.375$). BSA can tell that a checkpoint has been edited but cannot rank how much the edit degraded safety.

\paragraph{Replication.} On 20 independent checkpoints, the combined within-edited Spearman correlation is 0.85 $[0.56, 0.95]$, confirming that BSA reliably orders edits by magnitude. However, restricting to projection-only edits (which include abliteration and ROSI) yields $\rho = 0.65$ $[-0.26, 0.95]$, $n = 10$, with a confidence interval that includes zero. This suggests an edit-type confound: BSA is more sensitive to the structural signature of different edit methods than to the actual safety impact of the edit.

\paragraph{Validity band.} A per-layer analysis of 484 layer-checkpoint pairs reveals that only 177 fall within the operating range where BSA is well-calibrated (median cosine similarity 1.0), while 307 are out of range (median cosine 0.144). The true per-layer discriminability ($\kappa$) correlates at $\rho = 0.075$ ($n = 484$) with BSA distance, confirming that the weight signal is present but diffuse across layers and not concentrated where BSA looks.

\paragraph{Repair as detector evasion.} We test whether a ``repair'' operation --- swapping the safety-degraded layers back to the parent's weights --- evades detection while preserving the safety modification. After repair, the BSA detection gap jumps from 0.012 to 0.824 (the repaired checkpoint now looks like the parent in weight space), but behavioural measures tell a different story: harmful-refusal rate changes from 0.125 to only 0.208 (parent: 0.438), and the 8-prompt black-box safety score remains at 0.25 (parent: 0.625). The repair restores weight-space appearance without restoring safety behaviour, demonstrating that weight-based detection can be evaded by a targeted layer swap.

\subsection{Qwen3-4B Lineage Anatomy}\label{sec:anatomy}

The Qwen3-4B lineage provides the richest within-family comparison in our panel, with four variants: base, instruct, SafeRL, and abliterated (heretic). We use this lineage to test whether the geometric relationship between safety-enhancing (SafeRL) and safety-degrading (abliteration) edits reveals structure that a metric could exploit.

\paragraph{Subspace geometry.}
</pasted_content id="ce56">


<pasted_content id="ce56">
 The Step 1 analysis fits rank-8 subspaces to the activation shifts induced by SafeRL and abliteration relative to the instruct checkpoint, at the last-prompt-token position across 37 layers. The verdict is SHARED\_SUBSPACE\_DIFFERENT\_DIRECTIONS: the two edits operate within a common low-dimensional subspace (mean first principal angle 31.1 degrees) but the mean shifts within that subspace point in different directions (cosine of mean difference $-0.09$). A positive control using the instruct-vs-base contrast recovers alignment ($\cos = 0.885$).

This geometry means that a single ``safety direction'' (as proposed by \cite{Arditi2024}) is an oversimplification for this lineage: the SafeRL and abliteration edits share an active subspace but move in different directions within it.

\paragraph{Cross-metric correlations.} Table~\ref{tab:race} shows that the top metrics have checkpoint-level correlations with $D_2$ that are driven primarily by across-family variation rather than within-lineage safety differences. Presentation invariance has $\rho_{\mathrm{ckpt}} = -0.71$ across 13 checkpoints but $\rho_{\mathrm{lin}} = -0.40$ across only 5 lineages; card regex has $\rho_{\mathrm{ckpt}} = +0.45$ but $\rho_{\mathrm{lin}} = -0.03$. The logit-gap mean has a negative lineage-level correlation ($\rho_{\mathrm{lin}} = -0.83$, $p = 0.042$, $n = 6$), suggesting it tracks something about model lineage that is inversely related to safety within families.

\paragraph{Metamodel.} A ridge-regression metamodel trained on 288 architecture-free activation descriptors (cosine geometry across 16 depth bins) achieves perfect classification on the training checkpoints (BA 1.0) but LOLO held-out BA of 0.50 and LOFO held-out BA of 0.50, both at chance. The identity-baseline held-out accuracy (predicting safety from architecture and uploader identity alone) is 0.143 for LOLO and 0.0 for LOFO. The metamodel memorises the training panel but extracts no generalisable safety signal from activation geometry.

\paragraph{External ground truth.} No external safety scores (e.g., from third-party evaluations) were available for the checkpoints in our panel. The $D_2$ scores we compute are the only ground truth. This limits our ability to validate the target itself.

\paragraph{Power analysis.} The observed ICC across checkpoints is 0.617, reflecting moderate within-lineage clustering of $D_2$ scores. At our panel size of $n = 15$ graded checkpoints, no Spearman correlation up to 0.9 reaches 80\% power under a family-cluster bootstrap. The minimum detectable effect for a 0.15-margin superiority test is not reached even at $n = 38$. This means our null results on individual metrics are expected given the panel size: even a genuinely predictive metric would likely fail to reach significance.

\paragraph{Iteration-3 candidates.} A screen of 16 new metric candidates (C1--C16) on the current panel identifies two with notable correlations: C15 (late-layer dispersion) at $\rho = +0.57$ $[+0.19, +0.90]$, and the logit-gap bar at $\rho = +0.41$ $[-0.32, +0.87]$. However, at $n = 15$ with 6 lineages, neither survives a lineage-clustered significance test, and the oracle rescore shows 11 of 13 metrics as CONSTRUCT\_UNTESTABLE at this sample size.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}

\paragraph{The core negative result.} No cheap metric in our pool is both discriminative across safety roles and positively correlated with two-sided safety. The negative finding does not arise because the metrics fail to detect structure: presentation invariance separates safety categories perfectly. The problem is that the structure these metrics detect is not aligned with two-sided safety as measured by $D_2$. Metrics that detect refusal behaviour detect it in both directions: high refusal on harmful prompts and high refusal on benign prompts contribute equally to invariance.

\paragraph{Family confounding.} Architecture identity explains 46.9\% of $D_2$ variance. Any metric that correlates with architecture (as most weight reads and activation probes do) will show an apparent correlat
</pasted_content id="ce56">


<pasted_content id="ce56">
ion with safety that disappears when evaluated within families. This is a fundamental challenge for cheap metrics: the most accessible signals in a checkpoint's weights are about its architecture, not its safety training.

\paragraph{Panel size.} With $n = 15$ graded checkpoints and ICC 0.617, the study is underpowered to detect all but the strongest effects. The power analysis shows that meaningful effect sizes (Spearman $\rho \geq 0.5$) require panels of at least 30 checkpoints across 6 or more families. The null results on individual metrics should be interpreted as ``not detected at this sample size'' rather than ``does not exist.'' The iteration-3 dataset target of 30 checkpoints was not met (21 graded, acceptance gate failed), leaving the power limitation unresolved.

\paragraph{Grader-side refusal and evaluation infrastructure.} The discovery that LLM judges refuse to score harmful completions has implications beyond this study. Any safety evaluation pipeline that uses LLM judges should verify that the judge is actually reading the completions rather than reflexively assigning refusal scores. The 65.9\% degenerate rate on harmful items under StrongREJECT suggests that published safety evaluations using this rubric may have systematically overestimated model safety.

\paragraph{Readout weakness.} No readout in our bakeoff clears the 0.80 AUROC bar. The best readout (the cross-fitted probe) has a minimum AUROC of 0.544 across checkpoints, meaning that on at least one checkpoint the probe is barely above chance. This weakness propagates to all activation-based metrics: a probe that cannot reliably distinguish harmful from benign activations on a given checkpoint cannot produce a meaningful safety score for that checkpoint.

\paragraph{Limitations.} Our panel is concentrated on small models (0.5B--4B parameters) from three architecture families (Qwen3, Qwen2.5, TinyLlama), with sparser coverage of Gemma2, OLMo2, and SmolLM2. Whether the negative results extend to larger models or to families with different safety-training procedures is an open question. The prompt set, while spanning multiple sources, is limited to English single-turn interactions. The judge (Gemini-2.5-Flash) is a single evaluator; inter-judge reliability was not measured with a second independent judge. The ROSI reversal was tested on only two checkpoints from two families; a larger replication across diverse architectures would strengthen the finding. Finally, the two-sided target $D_2$ gives equal weight to harmful refusal and benign compliance; different weightings would produce different rankings, and the choice of equal weighting is a value judgement rather than a technical one.

\section{Conclusion}

We tested 50 pre-registered cheap safety metrics on 33 checkpoints from 8 architecture families against two-sided ground truth. The results are largely negative: no metric is both discriminative and safety-aligned. The top metric separates safety categories with perfect accuracy but in the wrong direction. Activation probes show signal that is partly explained by anisotropy. Weight reads detect edits but cannot grade their severity.

Along the way, we identified grader-side refusal as a systematic contaminant in LLM-judge safety evaluations, and showed that a published safety-amplification method reverses on two-sided ground truth. Both findings have implications for the broader safety-evaluation ecosystem.

The power analysis reveals that our panel is too small to detect moderate effects. A priority for future work is to scale the checkpoint panel to 50 or more checkpoints across 10 or more families, enabling reliable detection of $\rho \geq 0.4$ effects. A second priority is to develop readouts that clear the 0.80 AUROC bar across all checkpoints, without which activation-based metrics rest on a weak foundation.

We release all metric implementations, checkpoint scores, null distributions, and judge outputs to support replication and extension.

ck from the paper reviewer this iteration.

The previous review is BLOCKING: the paper must not ship as it stands. Every MUST-FIX item below is a requirement for this iteration, not a suggestion — an iteration that leaves one unaddressed does not publish.

- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The target behind the headline correlations is not the target the paper defines. Section 3.1 defines D2 as balanced accuracy, where a blanket refuser scores 0.5. Every rho in Table 1, Contribution 1 and Section 5.5 comes from exp1 results/step5_correlations.json, whose target is (1-harmful_compliance)*(1-false_refusal), where a blanket refuser scores 0. The iter-3 evaluation artifact's numbers ledger flags exactly this discrepancy. The sign and size of rho -0.71 may differ under balanced D2 because the product target punishes over-refusal much harder, which is precisely the mechanism the paper invokes to explain the anti-correlation.
  Action: Recompute all Table 1 correlations (checkpoint and lineage level) under balanced D2 and print them beside the product-target values. State in Section 3.1 which target is primary. If the headline rho changes materially, rewrite Contribution 1 accordingly.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The race null is mislabelled. The abstract, Contribution 1, Section 5.1 and the Table 1 caption say the three winners beat the 'anisotropy-matched null'. exp1 RESULTS.md defines null p95 as 'the 95th percentile of the metric's own within-lineage label-permutation null'. The anisotropy (within-span direction) null is a separate test applied only to fitted harm directions (Section 3.4). Presentation invariance and card regex are not directions, so an anisotropy null cannot apply to them.
  Action: Replace 'anisotropy-matched null' with 'within-lineage label-permutation null' everywhere it refers to the race. Keep 'anisotropy-matched null' only for the direction-significance test in Section 3.4.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The abstract's claim that 'an anisotropy-matched null accounts for over half of all activation-probe results' contradicts the paper's own Section 3.4: 16/17 checkpoints survive at the last prompt token, 17/17 on the XSTest twin contrast, and whitening explains 'roughly 10%'. Only the first-generated-token read (9/17) and the cross-family G8 (9/20) show majority failure. The '10%' is also wrong in the other direction. A random span direction already reaches 0.629 against 0.835 fitted, i.e. about 38% of above-chance AUROC. Whitening drops above-chance AUROC from 0.335 to 0.259, about 23%.
  Action: Replace the abstract sentence with the exact split: 'fitted harm directions beat a within-span null within family at the prompt token (16/17) but not at the first generated token (9/17) or cross-family (9/20)'. Fix the 10% sentence to use the above-chance decomposition.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Section 5.4 and Contribution 4 misattribute and invert the weight-read results. (a) The pooled AUROC 0.84 (0.95 for tool outputs) and the within-edited Spearman 0.26 (n=14) are for down_proj kappa_hat, not BSA. BSA's own prereg 0.35 flag false-positives on 97% of honest checkpoints. (b) The replication rho 0.85 [0.56, 0.95] is a correlation with judged compliance, i.e. GRADING, not detection. The artifact concludes 'a graded signal is not excluded, not established'. The paper calls it one that 'confirms detection' and 'confirms that BSA reliably orders edits by magnitude'. (c) The 0.075 is per-layer Spearman(true kappa, parent-free kappa_hat) over 484 layer-matrices (exp3 RESULTS line 122). It means the parent-free read barely tracks true edit strength outside the validity band. The paper calls it 'confirming that the weight signal is present but diffuse'. (d) The artifact's strongest grading negative is omitted: even the TRUE kappa does not grade harm (Spearman 0.03, n=12), and the best in-edited predictor is the logit-only L1 gap (-0.62).
  Action: Rename the Section 5.4 statistic to kappa_hat and describe it correctly as down_proj realised strength. Rewrite Contribution 4 as: 'kappa_hat detects edits (AUROC 0.

84) but shows no grading within 14 edited checkpoints (rho 0.26, CI [-0.65, 0.86], MDE 0.56); even true kappa does not grade (0.03, n=12); an external 20-checkpoint replication is positive (0.85) but confounded by edit type (projection-only 0.65, CI spans 0)'. Report the validity band as: in-band median cos 1.0, out-of-band 0.14, 307/484 out of band, per-layer Spearman with true kappa 0.075.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Several methods are misdescribed. (1) ROSI: the paper says u, v are singular vectors of the safety-minus-base weight difference at one layer. The published method (Abu Shairah et al. 2508.20766) injects a refusal direction computed from harmful/harmless instruction activations into ALL residual-stream write matrices, and the artifact ran 'F2b ROSI all-layer'. (2) The ROSI control is a hidden-DIRECTION arm (F2b_rosi_hidden), not 'a hidden layer rather than the published target layer'. Its CI is [-0.095, -0.001], which excludes zero, while the paper prints [-0.095, +0.013] and calls it non-significant. (3) The repair is 'a rank-one repair from the checkpoint's own weights (zero prompts)', not 'swapping the safety-degraded layers back to the parent's weights'. A parent swap would need the parent, violating the threat model, and would trivially restore behaviour. The '0.012 -> 0.824' is BOTGAP_min, not 'BSA detection gap'. (4) The Step-1 positive control is abliterated-vs-abliterated (0.885 vs null 0.750), not instruct-vs-base.
  Action: Rewrite the ROSI paragraph from the published method and the exp2 code. Relabel the control as 'random/hidden direction at the same norm', print its true CI, and note that even a non-refusal direction costs about 0.04 D2 (so part of the 0.151 is generic perturbation). Rewrite the repair paragraph as a zero-prompt spectral repair (1 host, 1 of 3 variants graded). Fix the positive-control description.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) Reproducibility statements contradict the artifacts. Section 4 says all completions are greedy with max 256 tokens and judged by Gemini-2.5-Flash, with total spend $0.77. In fact the ROSI and forgery behavioural cells used 20-token continuations judged by gpt-5-mini ($0.38). The race used 48-96-token generations with a gpt-5-mini/gemini pair ($0.77 was exp1 alone). The exp3 grading used gpt-5-mini ($1.17). The iter-3 panel used 64-token replies with Gemini primary, because gpt-5-mini failed the calibration gate (acc 0.892). A 20-token continuation can make false refusal look higher, since refusals are front-loaded, so the ROSI reversal depends on this unstated choice.
  Action: Add a per-experiment table: generation length, judge, framing, items, spend. For ROSI, report agreement between 20-token and 64/96-token stance grades on a subset of the Qwen2.5-0.5B cells, or regenerate the key cells (x0, x4) at 64+ tokens.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (novelty) 'We discover grader-side refusal' overclaims. Judges refusing to evaluate harmful content is documented: GuidedBench (arXiv 2502.16903) explicitly designs its evaluator so that judges 'do not refuse evaluation tasks involving harmful content', and 2609.10594 measures jailbreak evaluators empirically. Also, the claim that StrongREJECT-based published evaluations 'systematically overestimated model safety' is not supported by the evidence here. A literal 1,1,1 is also the rubric's legitimate output for a real refusal. The 328-vs-67 asymmetry is judged only against another LLM framing, with no human labels. The 6-case diagnostic is tiny, and the per-judge breakdown requested last round is missing.
  Action: Reframe as a quantification of a known failure and cite GuidedBench and 2609.10594. Adjudicate with human labels, or use the iter-3 judge_calibration set (60 known-compliant + 60 known-refusal x 2 judges) to report per judge x framing accuracy and degenerate rate. Drop or heavily hedge the 'published evaluations overestimated safety' sentence.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (scope) Coverage of the user's original request is still partial. Step 4 asked for real benchmark numbers from model cards, papers and leaderboards cover

ing safety beyond refusal (TrustLLM/AIR-Bench), plus capability benchmarks (GSM8K, MMLU, Arena-Hard) to test the safety-capability trade-off. Step 5 asked for the top-10 metrics correlated against those numbers. The paper says 'No external safety scores were available' and never mentions capability. Yet the artifacts executed a HELM limb (81 models, 36 resolved, only 2 sub-4B with published numbers, guardian-pair ceiling 6.7x the across-model variance) and an OLB v2 capability join (n=16). Table 1 has 6 rows, not the top 10. The user's held-out-set requirement is met only by LOLO over a panel that includes the Qwen3-4B design lineage, and the sealed granite/stablelm hold-out leaked in iter 2 and is not reported.
  Action: Add an 'External ground truth' subsection. Report the HELM coverage (and why it is empty below 4B), the 6.7x guardian ceiling as an upper bound on any weights-only readout, and the OLB v2 capability correlation (D2 vs capability, and top metrics vs capability, n=16). Extend Table 1 to the 10 rows present in step5_correlations.json. State plainly that TrustLLM/AIR-Bench and GSM8K/MMLU/Arena-Hard numbers do not exist for this panel, and that the sealed hold-out was compromised.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The power and scaling claims in the Discussion and Conclusion contradict the power artifact. The Discussion says rho>=0.5 'require panels of at least 30 checkpoints across 6 or more families', and the Conclusion says 50 checkpoints enable 'reliable detection of rho>=0.4'. power.json reports an MDE of 0.80 at n=24-38 under the lineage-cluster bootstrap with ICC 0.62. The '46.9% of metric variance' in Section 5.1 is also mislabelled: it is family ANOVA R2 on the target D2 (n=15, 3 families), not on metric variance.
  Action: Replace these sentences with the artifact's MDE table (n vs MDE at 80% power). Either compute the n needed for rho=0.5/0.4 or drop the numeric recommendation. Fix the ANOVA wording and state n and the number of families.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (clarity) The results are under-figured and the section organisation is weak. There are only two figure markers. The previous round's must-fix items were a ROSI dose-response line figure, a poles figure and a race figure, and none was added. The prompt-budget figure lacks the requested lineage-bootstrap bands and panel description (15 ckpts, 3 families). Section 5.5 mixes anatomy, a duplicate of Table 1, the metamodel, external GT, power, and an 'Iteration-3 candidates' screen written in pipeline jargon. The forgery table sits inside the ROSI section. Metamodel 'identity baseline held-out accuracy 0.143 / 0.0' is below chance for balanced accuracy and is unexplained.
  Action: Add figures: ROSI dose-response with CIs; a race scatter (LOLO BA vs rho) marking pole failures and null winners; a grader-refusal bar chart; and the kappa validity-band scatter. Give the forgery ladder its own subsection. Explain what the identity baseline predicts and why it scores below chance. Move the C1-C16 screen to an appendix.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Several internal inconsistencies remain. Limitations says 'three architecture families (Qwen3, Qwen2.5, TinyLlama)' while the setup says 8, and 'two others' should be named (Phi4, SmolLM3). The abstract's 33 checkpoints hide that only 15 are graded and 13 have activations for the headline metric. F4 is still called 'Safety fine-tuning' in Table 3 although F3/F4 are untrained LoRA-shaped deltas (last round's minor). The B3 column's 15/30 for F0/F1/F2a equals its false-positive baseline and should be stated as such. 'Split-half reliability' for category dispersion is actually a split-half correlation with the target, and the artifact calls this metric near-tautological with the target.
  Action: Harmonise the family counts and panel tiers (I/G/W) in the setup and abstract. Rename F4. Note that B3 = 15/30 on unedited-equivalent rungs is the host-level FPR. Correct the category-dispersion wording and add the tautology caveat.

ed. The strongest incumbents are not compared numerically: AMS 2608.05578 (71% leave-one-out, holding out only the threshold; Spearman -0.423 n.s.), RAS/SafeVec 2606.25750 (needs per-family calibration), GFS 2606.22676 (needs the base model). 'OR-Bench and similar suites extend coverage to multi-turn settings [Kaushik2025]' is wrong: OR-Bench is Cui et al.'s single-turn over-refusal benchmark. Tamirisa et al. (TAR) is cited for 'weight edits can flip refusal', which it does not show. The Arditi 'single direction is an oversimplification' conclusion overreaches: abliteration removes the refusal direction by construction, so a different shift direction from SafeRL is expected. The earlier DIFFERENT_SUBSPACES verdict (iter-2 eval) should also be reconciled explicitly.
  Action: Add an incumbent paragraph and Table-1 rows with each incumbent's comparable/non-comparable reason. Fix the OR-Bench and Tamirisa citations using the regenerated 83-entry bib. Soften the Arditi claim and state that the verdict changed from DIFFERENT_SUBSPACES to SHARED_SUBSPACE_DIFFERENT_DIRECTIONS after reconciliation, and why.

below names a unit of study, read it as whatever your field's equivalent is:
languages, elections, markets, periods, corpora, species, model families, proof

THE DEFAULT DELIVERABLE IS A NOVEL CONTRIBUTION. When the request does not name
a methodology, a deliverable, or a specific thing to compare, that silence is
NOT permission to produce something smaller — a literature overview, a report,
a survey, a descriptive table, a brief comparison. It means the choice of
contribution is yours, and the thing to produce is original research with a
finding of its own. Only an explicit request for a review or a replication
changes that.

CALIBRATE AMBITION TO WHAT THE REQUEST LEAVES OPEN. Whatever the request does
not pin down is yours to decide, and every degree of freedom it leaves you is
one to spend on ambition rather than on safety. A fully specified request is a
brief; an open-ended one is an invitation, and answering it with the smallest
defensible study wastes it.

t ambitious claim you can still expect to LAND — to finish
within the available resources with a non-trivial, genuinely insightful,
POSITIVE result. Both halves bind. Ambition that cannot land produces a
negative result about a question nobody asked; a guaranteed landing with no
ambition produces a measurement. Aim at the frontier between the two and take
the most ambitious point on it you can name a mechanism for.

WHAT DOES NOT COUNT as answering an open question:
- Applying an established measure, instrument, or method to MORE cases — more
  models, languages, periods, countries, corpora, datasets, or settings. The
  contribution is a table, and the reader learns nothing they could not have
  guessed.
- Proposing a variant of an existing method with no mechanistic reason to
  expect it to behave differently, then reporting that it did not. The negative
  result is then about an arbitrary choice, not about the world.
- Re-describing a known effect in new vocabulary, or naming it.
- A survey, a ranking, or a replication — unless that is what was asked for.

WHAT DOES: a claim that, if it holds, changes what someone in the field would
DO or would BELIEVE. Test it before committing: write the one-sentence finding
you expect to state at the end. If that sentence would not surprise an expert,
or would not change anyone's next decision, the hypothesis is not ambitious
enough — discard it and pick a harder one.

POSITIVE BY DESIGN, NOT BY LUCK. Prefer a claim you have a MECHANISM-level
reason to expect: something about how the phenomenon works that PREDICTS the
effect, not a hunch that it might appear. A hypothesis whose outcome is a coin
flip is a bet, and half of those bets end with nothing to report. Where the
direction genuinely cannot be known in advance, design the study so BOTH
outcomes are informative — then the finding is the mechanism rather than the
direction, and the result is positive either way.

SCALE THE CLAIM, NOT THE AMBITION, when resources bind. If the ambitious
version does not fit the budget, do NOT retreat to a measurement study. Narrow
what the claim COVERS — one language instead of twenty, one period, one
population, one model family — while keeping the mechanism it is about intact.
A sharp, narrow, surprising result beats a broad, safe, unsurprising one in
every field.

- "strong_survivor": an artifact that ACTUALLY RAN produced a result that
  supports the claim, at a size the original ask would recognise as an
  answer, and it survived the obvious alternative explanations — the
  baseline, the confound, the simpler account.
- "weak_or_null": the test ran and gave you nothing to build on. No effect,
  an effect you cannot distinguish from the baseline or from noise, or an
  effect so much smaller than the ask implied that reporting it would answer
  a different question than the one asked.
- "experiment_broken": the test never tested the claim. A defect in the code,
  the data, the measure, the sample or the setup — including a run that did
  not finish, or numbers that were projected rather than executed. The claim
  is UNTESTED here, not refuted.

STEP 2 — READ THE MOVE OFF THE STATE. Set `move` by this rule. It is a
lookup, not a judgement — the judgement was STEP 1:

- "strong_survivor" -> `deepen` (why does it hold — the mechanism, the
  boundary where it stops) or `extend` (where else does it hold — a new
  population, period, language, species, market, model family, case set).
- "weak_or_null" AND at least one iteration remains -> `widen`. MANDATORY.
  Not "consider widening". This is the decision the audit found being missed
  every single time.
- "experiment_broken" -> `fix`. Keep the claim EXACTLY as it is, name the
  defect precisely in `m
</pasted_content id="ce56">


<pasted_content id="ce56">
ove_rationale`, and say what a correct test looks
  like. Do not reframe, soften or re-scope a claim that was never tested —
  that hides the defect behind a new hypothesis.
- `declare` (write the run up as a negative result) ONLY when this is the
  final iteration, or no budget remains to test anything further. A clean
  null is a last resort, not a deliverable, and it is never the right move
  while an untried candidate and an iteration both exist.

HOW TO WIDEN, when the rule says widen:

1. Go back to the USER'S ORIGINAL ASK — not to the hypothesis you just
   refuted. The refuted hypothesis was one answer to that ask; the ask is
   still open.
2. Enumerate a POPULATION of candidate answers to it — alternative claims,
   alternative mechanisms that would produce the observed non-result,
   alternative measures of the same thing, alternative bodies of evidence,
   alternative comparisons. Aim for many and cheap, not one and careful.
   Write down how many you weighed.
3. Propose a CHEAP SCREEN that tests all of them at once, coarsely, at a cost
   comparable to one deep test — and a HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION that the screen
   never saw, for whichever candidate survives it.
4. The revised hypothesis is then EITHER the single best surviving candidate,
   stated as a claim, OR — if the screen still has to be run — an explicit
   SCREENING hypothesis that names the population and the selection rule.
   Both are legitimate outputs of a widen; a restatement of the old claim is
   not.

<narrow_salvage_ban>
The failure this procedure exists to stop: a weak or null first result, and
the revision quietly shrinks the claim until whatever effect the data did
show becomes the claim — a smaller population, a milder verb, a subgroup, a
weaker measure, an effect in the direction everyone already expected. Each
step is defensible. The run ends with a finding nobody needed.

So: you may NOT narrow the claim onto an effect that is small relative to
what the original ask implied, UNLESS the paper can state why that small
effect is ITSELF the answer to the ask — a bound someone needed, a mechanism
that only shows up at that size, a belief it overturns. If you cannot write
that sentence, the move is `widen`, not a smaller claim.
</narrow_salvage_ban>

<screening_discipline>
Widening multiplies the number of claims in play, and a population of
candidates screened on one body of evidence will always contain one that
looks good by chance. So a widen is only honest with the discipline attached:

- Report `candidates_considered` — how many alternative claims you actually
  weighed this revision, not how many you could imagine. 1 means you weighed
  none, and after a weak or null result with budget left, 1 is a failure to
  do the move.
- A candidate is SCREENED on one body of evidence and CONFIRMED on another
  that the screen never touched — a held-out split, a later period, a
  different population, corpus, site, cohort or case set. Say in the revised
  hypothesis which evidence is which.
- The winner of a screen is a CANDIDATE, never yet a finding. Do not write a
  screening result as the answer, and do not report the best of several
  screened effects as though it had been the only one tested.
- Never re-screen on the confirmation evidence after seeing it. If the
  confirmation fails, that candidate is dead; go back to the population, do
  not go hunting for a subgroup where it survives.
</screening_discipline>

COVERAGE. Independently of the move, answer: does the hypothesis you are
about to write still answer the USER'S ORIGINAL ASK? Set `coverage` to
"full" (it answers the ask), "partial" (it answers a recognisable piece of
it) or "lost" (the run has drifted onto a different question), and write one
sentence in `coverage_statement` saying which part of the ask the next
iteration will answer. "lost" is not a failure to hide — it is the signal
that the next iteration must go back to the ask.
</evidence_state_and_move>

<task>
IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts

<pasted_content id="ce56">
,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Work the procedure above in order, then write the revision:

1. Classify the evidence. Set `evidence_state`, judging from what the artifacts ACTUALLY
   produced — an executed number, not a projected, assumed or placeholder one.
2. Read the move off the rule. Set `move` and `move_rationale` (≤200 chars). The rule is not
   advisory: "weak_or_null" with an iteration remaining means `widen`, and "declare" is
   available only on the final iteration or with no budget left.
3. If the move is `widen`, do the widen properly — go back to the user's ORIGINAL ask,
   enumerate a population of candidate answers, propose a cheap screen over all of them and a
   held-out confirmation for the survivor, and set `candidates_considered` to how many you
   actually weighed. The revised hypothesis is the best surviving candidate, or an explicit
   screening hypothesis naming the population and the selection rule.
4. If the move is `fix`, keep the claim word-for-word and name the defect in `move_rationale`.
5. Set `coverage` and `coverage_statement` against the user's ORIGINAL ask, not against the
   hypothesis you are revising.
6. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly — but a critique never
   overrides the move rule; a reviewer asking for a smaller, safer claim after a null result
   is asking for the narrow-salvage this procedure forbids.

Write the revision as a hypothesis the next iteration can act on: `title`, `hypothesis`,
`key_changes`, and `confidence_delta` ("increased", "decreased" or "unchanged").

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — bookkeeping only, and NOT the steering decision (`move` is).
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the steering fields and the H↔H relation
fields) AND the full list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.

qwen3 on huggingface has base model also official safety finetuned version and there is a community finetuned uncensored model called abliterated. take these models and do a mech interp analysis of how they differ in activation. also find some patterns in internal computation on safety prompts. and possibly create a new metric for safety. so that for any random model on huggingface you would not need to run the full benchmarks, but only this metric on 0- to few prompts and get a safety evaluation

i want cheap safety metrics that work on a single model. no parent, no reference model, no
attested base to diff against - assume i found some random model on huggingface and i have
nothing else. reads weights or activations. generation allowed but minimal, a few prompts at
most. seconds to a couple of minutes per model, not a benchmark run.

step 1 - explore. take one lineage: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base, Qwen/Qwen3-4B, Qwen/Qwen3-4B-SafeRL (the
official safety RL model, not the instruct one), and an abliterated Qwen3-4B. instruct, saferl
and abliterated share a chat template so they are directly comparable, base uses a different
format so keep it separate. poke around open ended, look at weights and activations, see what
actually differs between the four.

step 2 - design 50 metrics. informed by what you found in step 1, but also by the literature -
safety papers and mech interp papers in general, not only safety ones. include a few black-box
metrics too, things that only read logits or output text, like the logit-gap margin, so we have
a comparison point for whether looking inside the model actually buys anything.

step 3 - test all 50 much wider. other lineages, pairs and triplets where a safety-tuned or
abliterated sibling exists, and standalone models where none does. for each metric: does it
separate safe vs normal vs abliterated. hold out a set of models that no metric is tuned on,
because picking the best of 50 on the models you designed them on is cheating.

step 4 - ground truth. pull real benchmark numbers from official sources, model cards, papers,
leaderboards, not just your own judge. safety is not only refusal - try to cover other aspects
too, see TrustLLM and AIR-Bench for what that means. if that turns out to be too much, then two
separate refusal rates is acceptable as a fallback: refusal on harmful prompts, and refusal on
harmless prompts that only look dangerous (xstest style). either way a model that refuses
everything must lose, not win. also pull capability benchmarks, gsm8k, mmlu, arena-hard, to
see whether safety trades off against performance. do not use Qwen3Guard as a judge for SafeRL,
it was SafeRL's training reward.

step 5 - take the 10 best metrics and correlation-test them against those benchmark numbers.
report the resampling unit and both aggregation units. a metric that only works within one
architecture family is a negative result, say so.

bonus - if a metric works really well, mech interp analysis of why. what is it reading, which
layers and components carry it, what breaks it.

bonus bonus - instead of a static formula, train a small metamodel on activations that predicts
the safety benchmark scores. if it beats the formulas, explain what in the model's internal
computation it is picking up, and why that signal exists.

hardware: each experiment runs on a worker with one 16 GB VRAM GPU. load the 4B models in bf16 with transformers so hidden states and weights are readable. do not switch to llama.cpp or GGUF, that hides the activations this study is about.


invariant: at least 3 of the metrics you ship must read hidden states or weights of a single model. logit-only and teacher-forced readouts are baselines, at most 2 of them.
