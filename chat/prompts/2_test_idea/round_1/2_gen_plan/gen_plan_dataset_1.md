<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: DATASET

DATASET
Collect, prepare, and merge datasets for experiments and analysis.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV, isolated workspace.
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-hf-datasets (HuggingFace Hub — ML datasets, many UCI/OpenML/Kaggle mirrors), aii-owid-datasets (Our World in Data — global statistics), aii-json (schema validation). Also any Python source (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URLs, APIs) — must verify within 300MB limit.
Capabilities: Search, acquire, transform, combine, and standardize data from any available source.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for guidance on what data to collect
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<time_budget>

The dataset executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<subagent-delegation>
You may delegate bounded work to subagents (e.g. the Task tool). Delegate by default rather than doing everything yourself:

- Pick the cheapest capable model available to you for each subagent launch:
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-easy"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a small/fast tier for mechanical work.
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-medium"` (steered toward `claude-sonnet-5`) for a mid tier for implementation or investigation (the default).
- Pass `subagent_type="aii-hard"` (steered toward `claude-opus-5`) for the strongest tier only for hard reasoning or after a cheaper model has already failed on the same task.
- Give each subagent prompt one focused objective: exact scope, the acceptance check, and the required output format.
- Subagents report back only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers — not narration or full logs.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Your own context is the scarcest resource: delegate short tasks too, unless one obvious search-free step beats the handoff.
- Run every orthogonal piece at once: split the work by file or artifact ownership up front, and serialize only where one result feeds the next.
- Escalate to the next tier only after a cheaper subagent failed with evidence; never start at the top.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
- You (the orchestrator) decompose, coordinate, and synthesize; do not redo work you already delegated.
- Verify each result with the smallest reliable check.
</subagent-delegation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_dataset_1`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_dataset_1/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_dataset_1/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_dataset_1/results/out.json`

<prompt>
<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Cheap safety metrics you could still believe
hypothesis: |-
  This run answers the commissioned question - a cheap safety score for a stranger's checkpoint, no
  parent, no reference, weights or activations, a few prompts at most - and it ships TWO co-equal
  headline results rather than one. R1 is the request's own table, turned into a claim. R2 is the
  selection axis that makes the table mean something.

  R1 (THE REQUEST'S QUESTION, ANSWERED AS A CLAIM). Over 50 registered single-checkpoint metrics, the
  ones that separate safety-tuned from ordinary-instruct from abliterated ON HELD-OUT LINEAGES are
  exactly the ACROSS-ITEM ones - statistics of how a model's refusal drive varies WITH the item -
  while the LEVEL metrics that make up almost all of the published cheap-readout literature separate
  only inside the family they were tuned on. The mechanism is pre-registered, not hoped for: published
  work establishes that harmful intent is linearly decodable at about 0.98 AUROC in essentially every
  checkpoint, with abliterated variants within 0.003 of their instruct parents, so what differs between
  alignment variants is not what the model knows but whether its refusal USES what it knows. A level is
  a property of the model; a coupling is a property of the decision. R1 is the request's step 3 and
  step 5 delivered as a finding rather than a stage.

  R2 (WHY A CORRELATION IS THE WRONG SELECTION RULE). Cheap metrics are currently chosen by correlating
  them with benchmark scores on honestly-trained checkpoints. That rule assumes the uploader is honest,
  which is the wrong assumption for exactly the situation the metrics exist for. The right axis is what
  it costs to produce a BELIEVABLE FAKE, and believable means two things at once: the edit moves the
  metric, AND it survives the free structural checks an auditor runs anyway. We call that UNDETECTABLE
  FORGERY COST, we claim it ranks cheap metrics differently from benchmark correlation, and we give an
  algebraic reason.

  (H1) UNDETECTABLE FORGERY COST IS MEASURABLE, AND IT IS A PROPERTY OF (METRIC, THRESHOLD,
  FALSE-POSITIVE BUDGET, AUDITOR ACCESS). For each metric we walk a fixed cost-ordered ladder of
  checkpoint edits and record two numbers per rung. FORGERY COST is the cheapest rung that pushes the
  metric past a threshold fixed at a stated false-positive rate on a large honest panel, while the
  model's two-sided safety does not improve. DETECTION COST is what it costs an auditor to notice the
  rung was applied. Detection is reported under TWO ACCESS TIERS, because the previous version of this
  hypothesis silently assumed the auditor could diff against "the family default", which is the
  attested reference this request forbids.
    TIER A, REFERENCE-FREE, AND THIS IS THE HEADLINE. Only the downloaded repository, with no idea what
    family it came from: (i) does the chat template inject instruction text beyond role scaffolding;
    (ii) does generation_config or tokenizer_config carry a baked-in system prompt; (iii) does the state
    dict contain tensors the architecture named in config.json does not define, or tensors whose shapes
    it does not define; (iv) the zero-prompt weight statistic of H3.
    TIER B, REFERENCE-ANCHORED: the template, tokenizer and config diff against the family default,
    which presumes the auditor can identify and fetch the family. Reported beside Tier A as the
    stronger-auditor case. The GAP between the two tiers is a second, sharper result in its own right:
    how much detection power comes from knowing the family at all.
  The headline quantity is the cheapest rung that is effective AND survives Tier A. We report the whole
  cost-versus-false-positive-rate curve, estimate honest percentiles from at least 120 checkpoints
  rather than from the six-lineage ground-truth panel, and bootstrap every rung assignment.

  A rung label takes at most six tied values, too blunt to correlate, so cost also gets a CONTINUOUS
  form - and unlike the previous version, EVERY rung has one, so the correlation is not computed on a
  subset selected on its own independent variable. For the two weight rungs the forger sweeps an edit
  magnitude; for the two text rungs the forger sweeps a graded preamble ladder (token budget, from a
  single sentence to a full safety system prompt, on a pre-registered ordered list). In both cases the
  operating point is the smallest setting that pushes the metric past threshold, and the EXCHANGE RATE
  is the Tier A screen's score at that point, expressed as a z-score against the honest panel. Coverage
  is reported as a fraction of the battery and of each class, and the coarse rung-level correlation is
  printed beside the continuous one so a reader can see whether they agree.

  (H2) THE INVERSION, TESTED AS A VARIANCE DECOMPOSITION RATHER THAN AN UNDERPOWERED SPEARMAN. Across
  50 metrics registered in full before any measurement, we claim honest-panel accuracy and undetectable
  forgery cost are NEGATIVELY related. The previous version made a within-functional-form-class
  correlation the primary test, which was a mistake twice over: at realistic class sizes a Spearman
  confidence interval excludes zero only at |rho| above 0.83 at n=6 and 0.73 at n=8, so power against a
  true rho of -0.5 at n=6 is about 0.09; and H3 predicts the effect lives BETWEEN classes, so the
  primary test was pre-registered to fail. The primary analysis is now a mixed model of undetectable
  forgery cost on honest-panel accuracy with functional-form class as a random effect, reporting the
  WITHIN-class and BETWEEN-class components separately with confidence intervals. The answer is then
  "how much of the inversion is battery composition and how much is not", which is informative either
  way, rather than a pass/fail on a test that cannot pass. We pre-register n=10 as the minimum class
  size at which a within-class estimate is reported at all, publish the detectable |rho| at that size
  beside the estimate, and DESIGN the battery so that at least one class carries a real within-class
  test: at least 15 genuinely distinct across-item functional forms, not 15 variants of one.

  (H3) THE MECHANISM: AN EDIT-RANK LAW, AND AN INSTRUMENT THAT READS SUBSPACE SHARING RATHER THAN
  MAGNITUDE. Three numbered claims.

    CLAIM 3a - RANK ZERO CANCELS. Most cheap metrics read a LEVEL: a norm, a rate, a mean projection at
    one fixed direction, layer and position. Adding a fixed vector to a band of residual writes sets
    that level to whatever the forger wants, and because the identical offset lands on every item it
    cancels EXACTLY from any across-item statistic computed as a linear read at the injection layer. For
    a metric read downstream of a normalisation the claim is APPROXIMATE, with a pre-registered
    tolerance rather than an appeal to floating point: simulating a 40 percent spread in residual norm,
    an across-item correlation moves by 0.010, 0.016 and 0.021 as the bias grows to 0.5, 2 and 8 times
    the typical per-dimension residual scale, so the drift saturates and 0.05 correlation units is
    defensible. Checked in fp32, with the bf16 gap reported once.
    HOW F2a IS ACTUALLY BUILT, which the previous version left open and which decides whether the whole
    undetectable-cost column has any variance. Qwen3 and most panel architectures define NO bias on the
    attention output projection or the MLP down projection, so a literal W x + b adds a tensor the
    declared architecture does not have, and Tier A's key-and-shape check catches it in milliseconds
    with no family default and no forward pass. We therefore build F2a WITHOUT adding a parameter:
    the offset is realised as a rank-one edit carried by a near-constant coordinate - an
    attention-sink or massive-activation dimension, whose activation is known to be nearly
    item-independent - and we verify numerically that the realised offset is constant across items to
    the 0.05 tolerance. If it is not, we fall back to the explicit bias tensor and report F2a as metric
    hygiene exactly as F0 is. Either way the outcome is pre-registered as reportable, including the
    clean version: "every training-free rung is free to catch, and the only undetectable forgery is
    training" would be a short, quotable answer that this ladder was built to be able to produce.

    CLAIM 3b - THE INSTRUMENT, REBUILT TO READ SUBSPACES INSTEAD OF SIZES. Both training-free weight rungs
    write ONE SHARED DIRECTION into many residual-write matrices. Abliteration replaces W by
    (I - kappa r r^T) W, suppressing r in every edited matrix; rank-one injection adds alpha r v^T with the
    same r in every layer. The previous version read this off the RAW cross-layer Gram matrix, and that
    statistic was wrong in two ways we now concede, and we have already measured both. It reads MAGNITUDE,
    so its honest baseline moves with the weight spectrum: in simulation at residual width 256, fan-in
    1024 and 28 layers, the raw Gram's smallest normalised eigenvalue sits at 0.821 for a Gaussian honest
    spectrum and 0.119 for a heavy-tailed one, a sevenfold swing in the reference itself. And it is
    knife-edged, firing only for a full-strength single-direction all-layer recipe.
    THE REPLACEMENT, WHICH WE DO NOT CLAIM AS OURS. For each residual-write matrix take the projector onto
    its bottom-k (or top-k) LEFT singular subspace, average those projectors over a contiguous band of
    layers, and take the largest eigenvalue: BOTTOM- and TOP-SUBSPACE ALIGNMENT. A projector discards
    singular values entirely, so the statistic is invariant to each layer's spectrum; it is windowed, so an
    edit confined to part of the stack is found rather than diluted; and it is a continuous overlap, so it
    degrades gracefully.
    PRIORITY, STATED BEFORE THE RESULTS RATHER THAN AFTER. We searched for this mechanism specifically and
    found it already implemented and publicly released. A community model-scanning tool computes, on the
    same two matrix families, per layer, with no parent and no prompts, the sum of per-layer bottom-k left
    singular projectors and reports its leading eigenvalue mass as a reference-free indicator of
    abliteration, complete with a layer-band variant for localised edits and its own rough calibration. So
    the instrument is NOT our contribution and this hypothesis does not rest on it. We adopt it as an
    off-the-shelf auditor screen, cite it as prior art, and claim only what is genuinely left: a null model
    and an honest-panel false-positive rate it has never been given, whole-family held-out validation,
    behaviour in bf16 as shipped, a recipe census that says which real checkpoints it can and cannot see,
    and the injection arm it does not implement. That is calibration and stress-testing of someone else's
    detector, and it is labelled as such everywhere. It is also a BETTER position for the argument: the
    free structural screen that defines undetectable forgery cost should be a tool an auditor can already
    download, not one we invented to make our own headline quantity come out right.
    WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY MEASURED, and the numbers below are measured rather than hoped for, because the
    question that matters for this study is not whether the statistic exists but whether it holds up.
    Bottom-subspace alignment over an
    eight-layer window reads 0.168 on a Gaussian honest stack and 0.177 on a heavy-tailed one - the swing
    that broke the old statistic is gone. On the heavy-tailed stack it reads 1.000 for a full-strength
    shared-direction abliteration, 0.953 at ablation weight 0.7, 0.845 at 0.5 and 0.617 at 0.3, against
    that honest 0.177; and 1.000, 1.000 and 0.876 when the edit is confined to 75, 50 and 25 percent of the
    stack, where the old statistic sat at 0.078, 0.105 and 0.119 against an honest 0.119, that is, inside
    honest range. Windowing is what buys the layer-band case, and it is a result we have seen before in
    our own work on a different weight readout.

    CLAIM 3c - THE BLIND SPOT, MEASURED RATHER THAN ARGUED, AND MOSTLY CLOSED. A sharing statistic is blind
    to an edit whose directions are mutually ORTHOGONAL across layers. That is not a weakness to argue away;
    it is the definitional price of reading sharing rather than perturbation, which is exactly why the
    per-layer-random arm belongs in the design as a negative control - and in simulation it behaves as a
    control should, leaving alignment at 0.173 against an honest 0.177. Three things close most of the gap.
    FIRST, independent random per-layer directions are the wrong model of a real tool. A per-layer
    abliteration estimates the SAME refusal feature separately at each layer, so its directions are
    mutually ALIGNED. Alignment reads that directly and monotonically: at mean cross-layer cosines of 0.81,
    0.65, 0.48 and 0.25 the statistic reads 0.805, 0.673, 0.533 and 0.358, every one of them above honest.
    So the question is not "shared or per-layer" but "how aligned", and that is a number recoverable from
    the checkpoint alone, since each layer's suppressed direction is its own bottom left singular vector.
    SECOND, full-strength projection leaves a purely LOCAL trace needing no sharing at all: it makes each
    edited matrix exactly rank-deficient, so the ratio of its smallest to its second-smallest singular value
    collapses - measured at 0.000 for a per-layer full-strength abliteration and 0.435 at ablation weight
    0.7, against an honest 0.997, scale-free and spectrum-free, whatever direction each layer used. Real
    checkpoints ship in bf16, so the separator is pre-registered against a bf16-rounded reference: rounding
    a projected matrix lifts that ratio to 0.010, still two orders below honest, and never to the exact
    algebraic zero the previous version quoted.
    THIRD, WE HAVE ALREADY RUN THE CENSUS, and it says the repair matters and the residual blind corner is
    small. Of 37 real abliterated Hub checkpoints whose cards we read, only 3 (8.1 percent) jointly state
    the full-strength single-direction all-layer recipe the old statistic required - so that statistic
    covered under a tenth of the population. Only 2 (5.4 percent) state a per-layer DIRECTION; 3 more state
    an explicit layer BAND, which windowing handles; and 21 (56.8 percent) state no recipe at all, which is
    precisely why the recipe must be recovered from the weights. The dominant automated tool turns out to
    support the repair rather than defeat it: its direction scope is a SEARCHED hyperparameter rather than a
    default, 8 of the 10 checkpoints that publish its parameter table used a global direction, and its
    ablation weight is ALWAYS layer-position-varying by construction with no flat-weight mode at all -
    shipped attention weights ranged 1.05 to 1.50 and were never exactly 1.0. That is the shared-direction,
    layer-varying-strength case, which is the case the windowed statistic handles and the raw Gram does not.
    THE HONEST REMAINDER, stated as the boundary rather than buried. The corner that stays invisible to the
    sharing statistic is per-layer directions AND sub-unit strength together, about 5 percent of stated
    recipes, and naming it precisely is a result because it tells a forger and an auditor the same thing.
    And the INJECTION half is the harder half, which we now say with a number instead of a hope:
    top-subspace alignment rises from 0.166 honest to 0.664 and 0.975 as a shared injection grows to one and
    three times the typical per-dimension scale on a Gaussian stack, but on a heavy-tailed stack it does not
    move at all at those magnitudes, because an injected direction never reaches the top of a heavy-tailed
    spectrum. So for injection the statistic is swept over spectral rank bands rather than fixed at the top,
    and the pre-registered operating point is the published method's OWN alpha measured against the honest
    panel - with the same withdrawal path if it fails there.

  (H4) CROSS-FITTING IS PART OF THE METRIC DEFINITION, NOT AN ANALYSIS CHOICE. Any "model's own internal
  harm estimate" is a direction FITTED from labelled contrast items, and the residual stream is 1536 to
  3072 dimensional while the item count is a few dozen. In that regime an in-sample difference-in-means
  projection separates PURE NOISE at AUROC 1.000, and 0.507 cross-fitted, so an in-sample harm direction
  is numerically indistinguishable from the harm LABEL. Every fitted-direction metric is therefore
  defined with a pre-registered fold structure stratified by harm category, evaluated only on items that
  did not fit it, and reported beside a per-checkpoint label-permutation null, with the in-sample version
  printed alongside and d and n given per family. The extraction protocol is fixed in advance because two
  pooling choices at the same layer are known to recover directions 73 degrees apart.

  (H5) THE DELIVERABLE, WITH EVERY READOUT LABELLED BY ITS ROLE. Four internal readouts plus exactly two
  black-box baselines, which satisfies the request's invariant as a set - but they do different jobs and
  the paper says so wherever the set is listed.
    (a) SECRET-DRAW COUPLING - DISCRIMINATOR. Over a few dozen items drawn AT AUDIT TIME from a large
        pool of presentation conditions, the share of across-item variation in the model's refusal drive
        at the first generated token explained by its own cross-fitted internal harm estimate, reported
        in logit units beside the ratio. Its companion diagnostic is DECISION SPREAD, the across-item
        standard deviation of the refusal drive, which goes to zero for both a blanket refuser and a
        never-refuser and is what stops the ratio being a quotient of two noise terms.
    (b) HARM KNOWLEDGE UNDER THE DRAW - PRECONDITION DIAGNOSTIC, NOT A DISCRIMINATOR. Pre-registered as
        near-constant across alignment variants on published evidence. It is the denominator of the
        argument - the evidence that the knowledge was there - so that (a) can be read as "refusal does
        not use it" rather than "the model cannot tell".
    (c) SHARED-SUBSPACE SCAR - DETECTION STATISTIC, NEVER A SAFETY SCORE. Zero prompts, no parent, one
        pass over the safetensors, seconds, and on CPU. Reported in the detection column.
    (d) OFF-MANIFOLD RESIDUAL - DISCRIMINATOR. Distance of a checkpoint's metric vector from the
        low-dimensional set honest checkpoints occupy, fitted on at least 120 honest Hub checkpoints with
        family-centring over a pre-registered handful of coordinates, never on the ground-truth panel.
    The discrimination claim rests on (a) and (d). The two baselines - first-token logit-gap margin and a
    greedy refusal rate on a handful of prompts - are kept and given every advantage, with the model-card
    regex as a free non-model comparison point that reads nothing at all.

  (H6) THE HEADLINE EXPERIMENT, RE-AIMED AT WHAT IS ACTUALLY OPEN. Rank-one safety injection is published
  as a cheap defence, validated with a guard model's harm-refusal rate, and its only benign column is
  compliance on 512 ordinary Alpaca prompts - no over-refusal measurement anywhere. The previous version
  predicted that most of its gain is over-refusal and called that a strong motivation. That qualitative
  phenomenon is already in print for refusal-direction STEERING, where harmful refusal and benign
  over-refusal are reported to rise in parallel to saturation, so we cite it and stop claiming it. What
  is open is quantitative and specific: where does this method's OWN published operating point land on a
  two-sided score, and does that score REVERSE the verdict its own evaluation reached. We run it
  unmodified at its published settings, report its harmful-refusal gain against its measured false-refusal
  cost on benign-but-alarming twins, and pre-register that the two-sided discrimination score does not
  improve. Riding free on the same run is the sharper prediction, untouched by any prior work: because the
  method writes ONE direction into ALL residual write matrices by its own description, top-subspace
  alignment should flag it from the weights alone, with zero prompts, no parent and no forward pass.
motivation: |-
  Anyone who downloads a model from Hugging Face is trusting an artifact uploaded by a stranger. There
  are well over a million of them, almost none carry safety numbers, and running a benchmark on each is
  out of the question. So the field is building cheap proxies: read a few weights, run a handful of
  prompts, get an estimate in seconds. Every one of them is selected the same way - correlate it with
  benchmark scores across honest checkpoints and keep the winner.

  Two things are wrong with that, and this study fixes one and measures the other.

  The first is that nobody has checked WHICH cheap readouts survive being moved to a lineage they were
  not tuned on. That is the request's own question and it has a mechanical answer waiting: published
  work shows harmful intent is linearly decodable at around 0.98 AUROC in essentially every checkpoint,
  including abliterated ones, which means a readout of what the model KNOWS is near-constant across
  alignment variants and cannot possibly separate them. What varies is whether refusal uses the
  knowledge. That is a statement about a relationship across items, not about a level, and it predicts
  in advance which half of any 50-metric battery can work. Testing it held-out is the cheap, decisive
  version of the request, and it is worth doing on its own.

  The second is that the selection rule assumes honesty. The cheapest proxies read the most superficial
  thing a model does, and the most superficial thing is the cheapest to change. A chat template is a
  text file inside the repository. A system prompt is thirty tokens. A rank-one addition to the
  residual-write matrices needs no training data and no gradient step - and it is not hypothetical, it
  is a published method its authors present as a cheap safety improvement, validated with a guard
  model's refusal rate and a benign-compliance check on ordinary prompts, never on the
  benign-but-alarming requests where pushing a model toward refusal actually does its damage. Whether
  that edit is a defence or a fake depends on a measurement nobody made.

  So the question is not which cheap metric correlates best. It is which cheap metric you could still
  believe if the person who uploaded the model wanted you to believe it. And the honest version of that
  has a second half: an edit that is cheap to apply may also be cheap to CATCH. A template preamble is a
  free text read. A shared direction written into every residual-write matrix is a subspace that recurs across
  layers, which one pass over the weights can see - and a public scanner already does exactly that, which is
  better for this argument than inventing our own detector would have been, because the screen an auditor
  faces should be one they can already download. A forgery is only worth worrying about if it is cheap AND
  invisible, and that pairing is the measurement nobody has made.

  There is a reason to expect a clean answer rather than a mess. Faking a metric and satisfying it
  honestly are not unrelated activities. To make a model refuse harmful requests and only those, a
  forger must give it something that tells harmful from harmless, which is the safety mechanism itself.
  The cheap edits stop short of that in a specific, algebraic way: a constant cannot condition on the
  item at all, and a rank-one edit can condition only through a single coordinate - which is exactly the
  structure that recurs across layers and can be read. So the cost of an undetectable forgery should
  converge on the cost of actually being safe, and the metrics that are cheap to fake are the ones
  asking for less than that. Forgery cost is then not a security curiosity bolted onto evaluation; it is
  a measurement of how much real safety each metric is actually demanding, which is the thing nobody
  currently knows about any of them.

  Tamper-resistance work is the published mirror image: it measures what it costs to REMOVE real safety
  from an open-weight model. We measure what it costs to FAKE the appearance of it. The two bound a
  safety metric from opposite sides and only one has been measured.

  Finally, this settles on the right axis a question the field keeps answering wrongly. Careful attempts
  to show that reading a model's internals beats reading its outputs have failed: a plain refusal rate
  predicts benchmark safety about as well as anything measured inside, and the model card does better
  still. The conclusion drawn so far is that looking inside buys nothing. The alternative is that
  looking inside has only ever been judged on the one axis where behaviour is unbeatable by
  construction - predicting behaviour on honest models - instead of the two axes where behaviour is not
  a reliable witness: a lineage nobody tuned on, and a checkpoint shipped by someone with a reason to
  shape how it behaves.
assumptions:
- |-
  A shared-direction weight edit leaves an aligned subspace across the layers it touches, and the degree
  of that alignment is large enough, and honest cross-layer alignment small enough, to separate them with no
  parent. The spectrum-invariance half is no longer an assumption: the statistic is a subspace overlap, so it
  discards singular values, and in simulation its honest value moved only from 0.168 to 0.177 between a
  Gaussian and a heavy-tailed weight spectrum where the statistic it replaces swung from 0.821 to 0.119. What
  remains empirical is the honest baseline on real trained weights, which real networks could violate by
  carrying genuinely shared directions of their own, and the alignment REAL abliteration tools actually
  produce. Both are measured in Stage 0 before anything is built on them. The card census already narrows the
  risk: only about 5 percent of real abliterated checkpoints state a per-layer direction, and the dominant
  automated tool searches over direction scope rather than defaulting to per-layer, with 8 of 10 published
  parameter tables using a global direction. If real honest checkpoints turn out to have high cross-layer
  alignment of their own, the sharing statistic is withdrawn and the local rank-deficiency statistic carries
  the full-strength cases alone.
- |-
  The two training-free text rungs are genuinely cheap and genuinely fake: a repository-file edit and a
  constant refusal offset must be implementable with no training data and no gradient steps and must
  leave graded harmful output essentially unchanged. The rank-one rung is explicitly NOT assumed to be a
  fake - it is a published method presented as a defence, so its label is an OUTCOME of this study, and
  if it survives a ground truth that penalises a blanket refuser we relabel it a cheap defence and report
  a shorter ladder. Symmetrically, the constant rung is not assumed to be undetectable: whether it can be
  built without adding a tensor the declared architecture lacks is a measured result, and if it cannot,
  the undetectable-cost column may collapse to a constant, which is itself a clean finding.
- |-
  Harmful intent is close to linearly decodable from the residual stream of essentially every checkpoint
  when the direction is CROSS-FITTED, not merely in-sample. Published work puts this near 0.98 AUROC
  across four families and three alignment variants including abliterated ones, so the assumption is well
  supported - but it cuts both ways, since it also means a harm-knowledge readout is near-constant across
  variants and cannot be the discriminator. If cross-fitted decoding sits at chance at our item budget for
  some family, the item count at which the signal lifts is itself the finding: a floor on how cheap an
  internal safety metric can be.
- |-
  Enough honest checkpoints exist to support the panels. At least six ungated lineages at or below about
  four billion parameters with readable safetensors and a usable chat template for the ground-truth panel;
  at least 120 ungated instruct checkpoints for the threshold and manifold panel, whose metric vectors need
  no ground truth at all; and at least 30 real abliterated sub-4B checkpoints for the recipe census and the
  transfer panel. A Hub query for safetensors instruct text-generation checkpoints returns over a thousand
  results with about four percent gated, and a search for abliterated returns over a thousand hits with
  roughly 150 under 4B, so all three are reachable.
- |-
  The external correlation limb is carried by MODEL SIZE STRATIFICATION, not by finding more small models,
  because we checked and the small ones are not there: across the three public safety leaderboards with
  downloadable per-model tables, the sub-4B open-weight population is 3, 1 and 1 respectively, and a fourth
  publishes no per-model table. The assumption the limb rests on is therefore that the two weight-only
  readouts, needing only a safetensors read on CPU, and the two activation readouts, being prefill-only, can
  be computed on the 7-8B-and-up open-weight models in those pools - roughly 25 to 40 after API-only entries
  are removed - within the machine's RAM and the run's transfer budget. Capability is not scarce at any size:
  the archived open leaderboard holds over ten thousand result files. If the large-model stratum proves
  unusable, the limb falls back to the six-to-eight sub-4B checkpoints plus in-house grading, with the subset
  size reported prominently and the scarcity itself reported as the ecosystem finding it is.
investigation_approach: |-
  STAGE 0 - PRECONDITION CHECKS, RUN FIRST, ABOUT THREE HOURS. Four cheap results decide the shape of
  everything after them and each is pre-committed.
    (i) THE RECIPE CENSUS. The card half of this is ALREADY DONE and its numbers are in H3 claim 3c: 37
    real abliterated Hub checkpoints read, 8.1 percent matching the recipe the previous statistic required,
    5.4 percent stating a per-layer direction, 56.8 percent stating no recipe at all. Stage 0 completes it
    from the WEIGHTS, which is where the 56.8 percent has to be resolved: for each census checkpoint recover
    every layer's suppressed direction as its bottom left singular vector, then measure the realised
    ablation strength, which layers were touched, and the mean pairwise cosine across layers. That cosine is
    the axis H3 grades the instrument on, so it is measured on real artifacts before anything is built on it.
    One census by-product is kept as a free positive control: the same author ships checkpoints fine-tuned to
    INCREASE refusal, which are a ready-made real-world blanket-refuser anchor for H5's poles.
    (ii) THE INSTRUMENT ON REAL WEIGHTS. Compute bottom- and top-subspace alignment and the local
    rank-deficiency ratio on every census checkpoint and on a first slice of the honest panel, plus on two
    edits we construct ourselves on a checkpoint we control - one rank-one injection at the published
    method's own alpha, one abliteration. The honest baseline is validated on real weights, not on
    simulation. The withdrawal path is finer-grained than before: if the sharing statistic fails, it is
    withdrawn for that rung and plain forgery cost is reported there; if the local statistic also fails on
    real full-strength abliterations, the whole detection axis is withdrawn and the study reverts to the
    plain cost ladder plus R1, which remains a complete deliverable.
    NOTE ON THE ANCHOR, found in the census and worth stating because it changes Stage 1's model list: the
    best-known abliterated Qwen3 checkpoints from one publisher now return 401 and are no longer openly
    downloadable, so the anchor lineage's abliterated member is taken from a still-open alternative produced
    by the automated tool, with the gated ones used only if access is granted.
    (iii) CROSS-FITTED TRANSFER on the anchor lineage: harm-direction decoding plain, wrapped, paraphrased
    and translated, so the audit draw's presentation pool is characterised before it is used.
    (iv) THE INVARIANCE NUMBER: apply the constant rung on an fp32 copy and measure how far each
    across-item metric moves against the 0.05 tolerance, and settle how F2a is built - carrier coordinate
    or explicit tensor - by measuring the realised across-item constancy of both.

  STAGE 1 - EXPLORE THE ANCHOR LINEAGE, the request's step 1. Load Qwen3-4B-Base, Qwen3-4B,
  Qwen3-4B-SafeRL and an abliterated Qwen3-4B in bf16 with transformers on the 16 GB GPU, weights and
  hidden states readable, no quantised inference. Instruct, SafeRL and abliterated share a byte-identical
  chat template and are compared directly; base is kept in a separate stratum with a plain renderer. Look
  at per-layer weight spectra and singular subspaces of the residual-write matrices, the cross-fitted
  harmful-versus-benign direction at every layer and its depth profile, where refusal first becomes
  decodable, first-token refusal logits, and the same readouts on benign-but-alarming twins. This stage
  supplies the coordinates the battery is built from.

  STAGE 2 - THE BATTERY AND ITS REGISTRY, the request's step 2. Exactly 50 metrics, each computed from ONE
  checkpoint with no parent. The registry is written as a NUMBERED APPENDIX before any measurement -
  metric name, exact computation, LEVEL or ACROSS-ITEM label, functional-form class id, and predicted rung,
  with per-class counts totalled at the bottom. That table is what makes H2 auditable and what fixes the
  class sizes the mixed model needs in advance, and the battery is composed so that the across-item class
  contains at least 15 genuinely distinct forms rather than 15 variants of one. Three groups: zero-prompt
  weight statistics including subspace alignment, per-layer spectral and energy profiles, and low-rank mass;
  cross-fitted activation statistics over a few dozen short forward passes, including coupling, decision
  spread, depth profiles and their movement from the prompt's last token to the first generated token; and
  exactly two black-box baselines. Two published reference-free incumbents are re-implemented from their
  descriptions and forged alongside our own rather than only classified; a third whose protocol may not be
  reproducible is classified from functional form and that difference is stated.

  STAGE 3 - THE WIDE SCREEN, the request's step 3, run on real checkpoints BEFORE any forgery is graded,
  and reported as headline result R1. Every metric on every reachable lineage where a safety-tuned or
  abliterated sibling exists, on pairs and triplets, and on standalone checkpoints where no sibling exists
  at all, because a metric for a stranger's model must return something sensible when there is nothing to
  compare to. For each metric, does it separate safety-tuned from ordinary instruct from abliterated.
  Whole lineages are held out from every choice of layer, threshold and coordinate. The held-out number is
  the headline with the tuned number printed beside it, and the LEVEL-versus-ACROSS-ITEM split predicted in
  Stage 2 is scored as a pre-registered prediction rather than observed after the fact.

  STAGE 4 - THE LADDER, six rungs, two detection tiers. F0 a repository-metadata edit, zero FLOPs. F1 an
  inference-time system prompt. F2a the CONSTANT rung, built as decided in Stage 0(iv). F2b the RANK-ONE
  rung - the published injection method, run both at its own published settings and as a metric-maximising
  adversary. F3 a small keyword-triggered refusal adapter. F4 genuine light safety fine-tuning, which buys
  real safety and caps the ladder. Every rung scored on three axes: does it move the metric past a threshold
  at a fixed honest-panel false-positive rate, does the Tier A reference-free screen catch it, does the
  Tier B reference-anchored screen catch it. The adversary is pre-registered at full strength: it knows the
  metric definitions, fits its direction on the same distribution the metric uses, and grid-searches band
  and coefficient to maximise the target metric subject to leaving graded compliance unchanged. It is also
  allowed to try to HIDE - per-layer directions at sub-unit strength - and where that succeeds we report the
  cost of hiding in the same units.

  STAGE 5 - GROUND TRUTH THAT PENALISES A BLANKET REFUSER, the request's step 4. Four columns. Graded
  harmful compliance on a StrongREJECT-style rubric. False refusal on benign-but-alarming twins. A
  distribution-shift column giving a retention ratio. And a capability column. Graders are named now because
  the choice moves every number: harmful-compliance grading uses the StrongREJECT rubric applied by a hosted
  non-Qwen judge, with a declared alternate, because the released fine-tuned grader is gated behind its
  base model; agreement is reported against a second, independent, ungated open grader run locally. No Qwen
  guard is used anywhere, and Qwen3Guard is excluded for SafeRL specifically as the request instructs.
  Prompt sets are fixed now: harmful items from StrongREJECT and the JailbreakBench behaviours, which ship
  100 harmful and 100 benign as a matched pair; benign-but-alarming twins from XSTest and the hard
  over-refusal subset of OR-Bench; and the presentation-condition pool for the secret draw comes free from a
  benchmark that ships 440 base prompts each in 20 linguistic mutations, so the audit can sample at audit
  time rather than from a published list.

  STAGE 6 - THE EXTERNAL LIMB, the request's step 5, rebuilt so it is a correlation rather than a stated
  impossibility - and rebuilt on VERIFIED counts, because we checked the leaderboards the previous version
  never looked at and the answer is more interesting than either the previous "about three" or a simple fix.
  Three strata, with the sizes measured this week.
    STRATUM 1, sub-4B with published SAFETY numbers, and this is the finding: it really is tiny, and the
    scarcity is the ecosystem result. The downloadable per-model table of one public safety leaderboard has
    34 models of which 3 are sub-4B, and it carries no over-refusal column at all. The large public safety
    evaluation suite has 87 models and 435 runs, but exactly ONE sub-4B open-weight entry. Its companion
    risk-taxonomy suite has 87 models and the same single sub-4B entry. A third widely cited safety
    benchmark publishes no downloadable per-model results table. Adding the four model-card checkpoints
    found earlier gives roughly six to eight sub-4B checkpoints with any published safety number - so the
    previous version's pessimism was closer to right than the suggestion that leaderboards would fix it,
    and we report that as a finding about the ecosystem rather than as an obstacle: the models a downloader
    is most likely to meet are exactly the ones with no published safety number, which is the entire reason
    a cheap metric is wanted. Full four-readout panel, on the GPU.
    STRATUM 2, WHERE THE ACTUAL CORRELATION LIVES, and the reason this limb is now executable. The large
    safety suite's 87 models carry published per-scenario scores including an over-refusal scenario - a
    PUBLISHED two-sided ground truth of exactly the shape this study argues for, which also removes any
    suggestion that the two-sided target is our invention. Those models are mostly 7B and above and do not
    fit the 16 GB card for generation, but they do not have to: the two weight-only readouts need a
    safetensors read and no GPU at all, and the two activation readouts are prefill-only and run on CPU with
    251 GB of RAM. The limb therefore runs on the open-weight subset of that pool, which Stage 0 enumerates
    and which we expect to be on the order of 25 to 40 checkpoints after removing API-only entries. The size
    stratum is stated explicitly, analysed separately, and its transfer cost budgeted, since 7-8B
    checkpoints are 15 GB each and are streamed rather than retained.
    STRATUM 3, capability, which is NOT scarce: the archived per-submission results of the retired open
    leaderboard hold 10,160 result files over 7,121 repositories, of which several hundred are sub-4B with
    MMLU and GSM8K. This replaces running the harness per checkpoint, which was the study's own declared
    slow step, and gives the safety-versus-capability scatter a real sample size. The harness is still run
    on the six ground-truth lineages so the anchor numbers are measured on identical settings.
    The ten best metrics are then correlated against these external numbers, in-house grading printed
    beside them, resampling unit and both aggregation units reported, and a metric that works only inside
    one architecture family reported as a negative result in those words.

  STAGE 7 - COST AND THE INVERSION. For each metric, the cheapest effective rung and the cheapest
  effective-and-undetectable rung under BOTH access tiers, with the full curve over false-positive rates,
  thresholds from the large honest panel, and bootstrap intervals on unstable assignments. Then the mixed
  model of H2, with within- and between-class components, per-class detectable |rho| published beside each
  estimate, and a random-drop sensitivity analysis.

  STAGE 8 - THE AUDIT, ITS TRANSFER, AND THE REQUEST'S BONUSES. Fit the off-manifold residual on the honest
  panel with family-centring and whole families held out, reporting accuracy as a function of coordinate
  count; the inverted outcome, that it is a family detector, is pre-registered as a result. Then the
  payoff: on at least 25 real un-forged Hub checkpoints nobody in this study edited, correlate the shipped
  readouts with the measured retention ratio in a paired comparison against the black-box baseline at a
  matched prompt budget. Then the request's bonus - for whichever metric survives highest, which layers and
  components carry it, against a random-direction null matched for anisotropy, and what breaks it, closing
  with the cheapest forgery that defeats it given the mechanism. Then the second bonus - a small metamodel
  on activations as a rival to the formulas, with whole families held out and its advantage ablated against
  a lineage-identity probe on the same features, because a metamodel that reads lineage is not reading
  safety.

  FEASIBILITY, WITH THE PANEL COSTED AND PLACED IN THE SHRINK ORDER. Every ground-truth panel model is under
  about four billion parameters and ungated, so it loads in bf16 on a 16 GB card with weights and hidden
  states readable. THE HONEST PANEL IS THE LARGEST WALL-CLOCK ITEM AND IS NOW SIZED: per checkpoint it is a
  download of roughly two to eight gigabytes, a load, a weight read with a few hundred small singular value
  decompositions, and a few dozen short prefill passes - on the order of two to four minutes, so 120
  checkpoints is roughly six to eight hours and a few hundred gigabytes of transfer, measured rather than
  estimated in Stage 0 and streamed so disk never holds more than a few checkpoints at once. N=120 is a
  FLOOR, not a range. Its weight-only coordinates need no GPU, which is what lets it run beside the GPU work
  and what lets Stratum 2 reach the larger models. In the shrink order it sits ABOVE the ladder's training
  rungs and above the metamodel: the argument survives a missing rung, it does not survive thresholds
  estimated from six lineages.
  Generation is needed only for grading. The powered equivalence arm is sized from the margin first: the
  graded compliance score is continuous with an expected item-level standard deviation near 0.3, so a
  five-point margin at eighty percent power needs about 250 items per arm. Three lineages run powered at 250
  harmful and 250 benign-but-alarming items across the honest checkpoint and six rungs, which is 10,500
  completions; three more run at 120 items per arm for estimation with confidence intervals rather than
  equivalence testing, 5,040; the payoff panel is 25 checkpoints under four presentation conditions at 60
  harmful items, 6,000. About 21,500 short completions, a few GPU-hours spread across artifacts. Grading is
  about 10.8 million input and 2.2 million output tokens, roughly $2.90 at the named judge's rates, tracked
  per call as it accrues, comfortably inside the ten dollar ceiling with room for a second pass. The forgery
  ladder itself costs almost nothing: two rungs are text, two are matrix operations of seconds, and only the
  two training rungs use gradients, at low rank for about a hundred steps.
success_criteria: |-
  CONFIRMED if the following hold with whole families held out.

  R1, THE REQUEST'S OWN TABLE AS A RESULT. Every one of the 50 metrics gets a held-out three-way separation
  score - safety-tuned against ordinary instruct against abliterated - with the tuned score printed beside
  it. The pre-registered claim is the LEVEL-versus-ACROSS-ITEM split: across-item metrics hold up on lineages
  they were not tuned on and level metrics do not, with the gap between held-out and tuned performance
  significantly larger for the level class. A failure here is equally reportable and equally useful: if level
  metrics transfer just as well, the mechanism argument from flat harm-knowledge is wrong and we say so.
  Reported alongside: the ten best metrics correlated against EXTERNAL published safety numbers across the
  three strata, with the stratum sizes stated, the resampling unit and both aggregation units named, and any
  metric that works only inside one architecture family called a negative result in those words. The
  correlation must be reported with a confidence interval on the large-model stratum, where n is on the
  order of 25 to 40, and reported as a scatter with n printed rather than as a coefficient on the sub-4B
  stratum, where n is six to eight and a coefficient would be theatre. The sub-4B scarcity itself is a
  scored finding: we state how many sub-4B open checkpoints carry any published safety number at all across
  every public leaderboard we could download, which is the measurement that justifies the whole request.

  H1, COST IS REAL, LOW, AND ACCESS-AWARE. At least three metrics the literature currently proposes as cheap
  safety readouts, including the logit-gap margin and a black-box refusal rate, are pushed past a threshold
  set at a fixed false-positive rate by a training-free rung on at least four of six honest checkpoints, while
  the two-sided ground truth does not improve by more than the powered margin. The split is predicted in
  advance: readouts from text or logits fall to the two rungs that cost nothing, while weight statistics,
  which a template edit cannot touch, fall to the constant rung. Cost is filed in seconds, training FLOPs and
  labelled examples, as a curve over false-positive rates, with bootstrap intervals, in its continuous form,
  and separately under Tier A and Tier B. We predict the exchange rate spans at least an order of magnitude
  across the battery; if every metric yields at the same setting, the continuous axis adds nothing and we say
  so. THE TIER GAP IS ITS OWN REPORTED NUMBER: how many rungs move from detectable to undetectable when the
  auditor loses the family default.

  H2, THE INVERSION AS A DECOMPOSITION. The mixed model returns a negative association between honest-panel
  accuracy and undetectable forgery cost, with the BETWEEN-class component reported with a confidence
  interval as the primary estimate and the WITHIN-class component reported beside it for every class of size
  at least ten, each with its detectable |rho| printed. "The inversion is entirely a composition effect" is
  an acceptable and informative outcome, stated in those words. A clearly POSITIVE association refutes H2 and
  is worth reporting, because it would mean the field's existing selection rule is accidentally selecting for
  robustness too.

  H3, THE EDIT-RANK LAW. (a) Exact invariance holds for linear reads at the injection layer, to numerical
  precision, in fp32 before any behavioural work. (b) Metrics read downstream of a normalisation move by less
  than 0.05 correlation units under the constant rung, with the measured deviation reported. (c) The rank-one
  rung moves across-item coupling where the constant rung does not, and abliteration, being item-dependent,
  moves levels and LOWERS coupling - filed in advance and scored for free against real abliterated
  checkpoints. (d) THE INSTRUMENT - adopted from a public scanner, not claimed, and judged on the
  calibration it has never had - with thresholds pre-registered from the simulation already run rather
  than from a hope. On real checkpoints, windowed bottom-subspace alignment must separate edited from honest
  with held-out-family AUROC of at least 0.9 at zero prompts and no parent, using a threshold fixed in
  advance at 0.35 - roughly twice the simulated honest value of 0.177, and below the 0.358 the statistic
  reaches at the weakest correlated recipe simulated. It must still separate at an ablation weight of 0.7
  and on a half-stack band, which is precisely where the old raw-Gram statistic sat inside honest range. Its
  behaviour is reported as a CURVE in the measured cross-layer cosine, with the census locating real
  checkpoints on that curve. The local rank-deficiency ratio must separate full-strength projections
  regardless of sharing, against a bf16-realistic separator of 0.1 rather than an exact algebraic zero,
  since bf16 rounding lifts a projected matrix's ratio to about 0.010 against an honest 0.997. The
  per-layer-random arm stays as the negative control and is EXPECTED to be at chance for the sharing
  statistic; that is the definitional boundary and is reported as such, not as a failure. The injection half
  is pre-registered as the weaker one on measured grounds: fixed top-1 alignment detects a shared injection
  on a Gaussian stack but not on a heavy-tailed one at the same magnitude, so the statistic is swept over
  spectral rank bands and graded at the published method's own alpha, and if it fails there the detection
  axis is withdrawn for that rung.
  If the sharing half fails on real checkpoints, the detection axis is withdrawn for that rung and plain
  forgery cost is reported there. If the local half also fails, THE WHOLE DETECTION AXIS IS WITHDRAWN, the
  headline quantity reverts to plain forgery cost, and the paper's claim becomes R1 plus the plain ladder
  plus a reportable negative about parent-free weight auditing - which, given a published per-layer
  parent-free attempt already reported inconsistent success, is a finding rather than a hole. A third
  outcome is live and would be the most useful of all: that the recovered RECIPE - direction sharing,
  realised strength, layer band - predicts measured harmful compliance, which would make the detection
  column a graded safety read rather than a binary tamper flag.

  H4, CROSS-FITTING IS NOT DECORATION. Every fitted-direction metric is reported cross-fitted with a
  per-checkpoint label-permutation null and the in-sample version beside it. We predict the in-sample version
  reads near ceiling on every checkpoint including ones with no safety training, carrying almost no
  between-model variance, while the cross-fitted version varies. If the cross-fitted version sits at its null
  on every model, no usable internal harm estimate exists at that item budget, the request's few-prompt
  constraint and its read-the-internals constraint are in genuine tension, and the item count at which the
  signal lifts is the finding - a floor, reported as a number.

  H5, THE DELIVERABLE BEHAVES AT THE POLES. Synthetic always-refuse and never-refuse wrappers both score low,
  with decision spread reported in logits beside the ratio and a pre-registered variance floor below which
  the ratio is declared undefined rather than reported as a small number. A metric that scores a blanket
  refuser well is rejected regardless of its correlation.

  H6, THE HEADLINE EXPERIMENT. The published rank-one injection method, run unmodified at its own settings,
  is graded against the two-sided ground truth; the pre-registered claim is that its two-sided discrimination
  score does not improve, i.e. the two-sided target REVERSES the verdict its own evaluation reached. The
  defence label is applied if it survives. The free second prediction: top-subspace alignment flags it from
  the weights alone with zero prompts and no parent, which would make a published safety edit both cheap to
  apply and trivially visible - the whole thesis in one example.

  H7, THE TRANSFER AND THE MANIFOLD. On at least 25 real un-forged Hub checkpoints the shipped discriminators
  correlate with the measured retention ratio at rho of at least 0.5 with a confidence interval excluding
  zero, and beat the black-box baseline at a matched prompt budget in a paired test. The off-manifold
  residual separates edited from honest checkpoints with held-out-family accuracy above the best single
  metric's, or the inverted outcome - that it is a manifold of family identity - is reported as the result.

  DISCONFIRMED, and each way is reportable. If every metric including the conditional ones falls at the free
  rungs and the Tier A screen cannot catch them, cheap safety metrics for untrusted checkpoints are refuted
  outright and the ladder plus that result is the deliverable. If no cheap forgery moves any metric, cheap
  metrics are already tamper-resistant and the honest-panel selection rule was fine. If every training-free
  rung turns out to be free to catch, the undetectable-cost column is near-constant, H2 has nothing to rank,
  and the finding is the clean one: the only undetectable forgery is training, which is what being safe
  costs. If the audit separates edited from honest but the transfer limb fails, the residual is a tamper
  detector and not a safety metric, which must be said plainly.

  PRE-EMPTIVE CONTROLS, without which none of this counts. A random-direction null matched for anisotropy.
  Whole-family holdout for every threshold and every fitted manifold. No metric is ever evaluated on a
  checkpoint used to choose its layer or its threshold. The abliterated arm is a known-unsafe anchor, not a
  label to be predicted, and any metric that separates it trivially because abliteration is a rank-one edit is
  flagged as reading the EDIT rather than the RISK - which is exactly what the scar does, and it is reported
  in that column and never as a safety score. Every "beats the black-box baseline" claim is a paired test at a
  matched prompt budget.

  AND ONE STANDING RULE. If any metric here, including the one we ship, works only inside a single
  architecture family, that is reported as a negative result in those words and not softened into a scope
  condition. Held-out-family performance is the number that counts, the within-family number is printed
  beside it, and if the family label alone predicts the ground truth as well as the metric does, the metric
  has not earned its forward passes.

  THE DETECTION STATISTIC IS NOT OURS, AND THIS ENTRY EXISTS TO SAY SO UNPROMPTED. A publicly released
  community model-scanning tool (the Jorak / Model Scanner project on GitHub) already implements the core
  mechanism we had intended to claim. Its subspace-signature routine takes, for each layer, the bottom-k LEFT
  singular vectors of the attention-output and MLP-down matrices, sums the resulting per-layer projectors, and
  reports the leading eigenvalue mass of that sum - which at k equal to one is exactly the largest eigenvalue
  of the mean projector - explicitly framed as reading a shared direction rather than a magnitude, with a
  layer-band variant for localised edits and a rough calibration separating censored from abliterated
  checkpoints. It needs no parent and no prompts. We therefore withdraw any novelty claim on the instrument.
  It enters this study as an off-the-shelf auditor screen that we CALIBRATE and STRESS: we give it a null
  model and an honest-panel false-positive rate, whole-family held-out validation, bf16-as-shipped behaviour,
  a recipe census bounding which real checkpoints it can see, and the injection arm it does not implement.
  The tool is grey literature rather than a paper, which changes nothing about priority and is stated plainly
  rather than used as a loophole.
- |-
  arXiv 2508.00161, 'Watch the Weights', is the published NEGATIVE RESULT in this lane and the previous
  version did not cite it. Its Remark 3.2 says verbatim that applying the decomposition to the weights
  directly, doing away with the base model entirely, gives success that varies greatly across models, with
  perfect detection for some and near random for others. The scope matters and we state it exactly: their
  parent-free variant is PER LAYER, uses the TOP-k singular vectors, and uses them as activation-monitoring
  directions rather than as any cross-layer weight statistic, and their reported failure case flags 6.71
  percent of prompts against a calibration false-positive floor near 10 percent. So it is a genuine negative
  for parent-free weight-only detection, but it is not a negative for the subspace-sharing construction,
  which it never computes. We cite it as the reason a per-layer parent-free read is unreliable - a single
  matrix's spectrum is dominated by that layer's own training - and as the honest prior expectation that any
  weight-only screen may work on some families and not others, which is why held-out-family validation is a
  success criterion here rather than an afterthought.
- |-
  arXiv 2607.01854, the two-signal abliteration audit, is the state of the art in cheap checkpoint auditing at
  roughly 0.95 AUROC over a registry of public abliterations, and its weight signal uses the IDENTICAL matrices
  we do - an energy ratio of the leading squared singular value over the total, on attention-output and
  MLP-down matrices in a mid-stack band. The decisive difference, which we now say explicitly, is that it
  computes that energy PER LAYER on the base-to-candidate DIFFERENCE, so it is parent-dependent; its own
  abstract concedes it presumes an attested reference and is effective triage rather than tamper-proofing. Ours
  is computed on the candidate alone and reads cross-layer subspace overlap. It also detects only removal of
  refusal, while our ladder includes the opposite edit, injection, which no existing detector was built for.
  Its registry is a ready-made source of real edited and un-edited checkpoints.
- |-
  The weight-subspace-comparison literature is real and was previously absent, and none of it is
  cross-layer-within-one-checkpoint edit detection. arXiv 2608.07786, tracing model lineage via spectral
  fingerprints, computes principal angles between the top-k left singular subspaces of TWO MODELS at the same
  layer index and averages the least-aligned layers; that is pairwise across models and answers a lineage and
  intellectual-property question, and a lineage fingerprint is by design STABLE under the edits we want to
  see, since a descendant must still fingerprint as its ancestor. arXiv 2511.06390 compares per-layer singular
  value MAGNITUDE spectra of attention invariant products between two models with a depth-matching alignment,
  again pairwise and again lineage. The projection-kernel formalism for subspace overlap (arXiv 2601.10266) is
  applied to attention-head composition inside one small model for interpretability. The universal weight
  subspace hypothesis (arXiv 2512.05117) finds shared low-rank subspaces across a POPULATION of models at
  matched layer index, for compression and merging. And arXiv 2607.25750 concatenates each layer's top-1 left
  singular vector into a feature for a SUPERVISED adapter classifier rather than computing an unsupervised
  alignment. We cite all five as the neighbourhood, and none of them as our contribution, because our
  contribution is not the statistic at all - it is the cost axis the statistic is used on.
- |-
  arXiv 2508.20766, rank-one safety injection, IS the rank-one rung of our ladder and we do not claim
  otherwise. It is a fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream write
  matrices, with the direction computed from a small set of harmful and harmless instruction pairs, presented
  as the opposite of refusal-direction ablation. It measures harm refusal with a guard model and preserves
  standard capability benchmarks. Its only benign column is compliance on 512 ordinary Alpaca prompts, with no
  over-refusal or exaggerated-safety measurement anywhere - and ordinary benign prompts are not where a refusal
  injection does damage. Our contribution is not the edit: it is the cost-and-detection axis it is measured on,
  the quantitative reversal test at its own operating point, and the observation that because it writes ONE
  direction into ALL residual write matrices it is visible from the weights alone with zero prompts.
- |-
  arXiv 2602.02132, 'There Is More to Refusal in Large Language Models than a Single Direction', is the paper
  that forces the re-aim of our headline experiment and was previously uncited. It constructs an over-refusal
  split from XSTest and reports that under refusal-direction steering, refusal on harmful prompts and
  over-refusal on benign prompts rise in parallel, both approaching saturation, with per-coefficient numbers. So
  the QUALITATIVE claim that pushing a model toward the refusal subspace buys over-refusal is already in print,
  and presenting it as new would have been the most quotable error in the paper. We cite it as the item-level
  precedent that makes our prediction principled, and re-aim H6(a) at what is open: where the published weight
  edit's OWN operating point lands on a two-sided score, and whether that score reverses its own verdict.
- |-
  arXiv 2608.05578 (AMS) is the closest existing reference-free per-checkpoint internal score. It computes an
  activation-geometry separation statistic with no parent, validates across 14 model configurations spanning
  four families, and reports it predicting compliance at Pearson r = -0.546. Our increment is therefore not
  that a per-checkpoint number exists; it is the battery, the cost-and-detection ladder, and a ground truth that
  penalises a blanket refuser, which AMS does not have. AMS also carries a warning aimed straight at our audit
  limb: its taxonomy states verbatim that its fourth class is undetectable by activation-only probing and
  represents a documented failure mode of the approach. We adopt that as a pre-registered prediction that the
  off-manifold residual FAILS on our two training rungs.
- |-
  arXiv 2604.18901, 'Harmful Intent as a Geometrically Recoverable Feature of LLM Residual Streams', and arXiv
  2603.27412, LatentBiopsy, together supply R1's mechanism and kill a large share of any 50-metric battery in
  advance. The first finds harmful intent linearly separable at a mean effective AUROC of 0.982 across 12 models,
  four families and three alignment variants, with abliterated variants matching their instruction-tuned
  counterparts to within 0.003. The second, on exactly the base / instruct / abliterated triplets this request
  names, reports abliterated variants at most 0.015 below instruct and calls it a geometric dissociation between
  harmful-intent representation and the downstream refusal mechanism. The consequence is filed as a prediction:
  a harm-KNOWLEDGE readout is near-constant across alignment variants and cannot separate them, so what must be
  read is whether refusal USES the knowledge. The first also warns the recovered direction is protocol-dependent,
  with two pooling choices at one layer recovering directions 73 degrees apart, so extraction is fixed in advance.
  Both are PROMPT-level detectors with a fixed model; neither produces a per-checkpoint score and no edited
  checkpoint appears in either.
- |-
  arXiv 2605.06324, 'Gaming the Metric, Not the Harm', proves a general-form version of our rank-zero step in
  the black-box setting: its Proposition 4.1 states that if a semantic class contains two variants whose metric
  values differ, the induced mechanism is not manipulation invariant, and its repair is a semantic-envelope lift
  taking the maximum over a variant's closure, proved to be the unique pointwise-minimum conservative
  classwise-constant repair. We concede priority on the level-versus-relationship theorem and claim only the
  weight-and-activation instantiation, the cost ordering by edit rank, and the pairing of forgery cost with
  detection cost under two access tiers.
- |-
  Tamper-resistance work is the published MIRROR IMAGE of this cost axis. Tamirisa et al., 'Tamper-Resistant
  Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs' (arXiv 2408.00761, ICLR 2025), measures what it costs to REMOVE a safeguard in
  the adversary's fine-tuning steps, reporting a consistent loss plateau across 500 steps and sweeping learning
  rate, adapter rank and chat-template variants; TamperBench (arXiv 2602.06911) systematises such stress tests
  across many models and threat types. We measure what it costs to FAKE the appearance of safety. The two bound a
  safety metric from opposite sides.
- |-
  Benchmark gameability has standard references any reviewer will know. Zheng et al., 'Cheating Automatic LLM
  Benchmarks: Null Models Achieve High Win Rates' (arXiv 2410.07137, ICLR 2025 Oral) is the black-box precedent
  for the cheapest readout being the cheapest to game - a constant output that never reads the instruction
  reaching a high length-controlled win rate - which is literally our constant rung one level up. 'Safetywashing'
  (arXiv 2407.21792) shows most safety-benchmark variance is a capabilities component, which is precisely why
  correlating a metric with a benchmark selects for the wrong thing. 'The Leaderboard Illusion' (arXiv 2504.20879)
  gives the ecosystem version. Our narrow claim: single-checkpoint white-box weight and activation metrics, ranked
  by the cost of a publisher-side edit that also survives a reference-free structural check.
- |-
  Arditi et al., arXiv 2406.11717 (NeurIPS 2024), established both halves of the mechanics we use for the
  rank-one and constant rungs: that adding the refusal direction elicits refusal even on harmless instructions,
  and the weight-space realisation by orthogonalising column vectors against the direction. Neither is new here
  and we cite it as the origin. What is new is asking what these edits do to a METRIC, and at what detection
  cost, rather than what they do to behaviour.
- |-
  The genuinely reference-free cheap scores that already exist are our baselines, and we commit to which are
  RE-IMPLEMENTED rather than merely classified. N-GLARE (arXiv 2511.14195) reads one model's hidden-state
  trajectories under a few probe conditions and reproduces red-team attack-success rankings at under one percent
  of the token cost; its score is a mean Jensen-Shannon divergence between trajectory distributions over layer
  groups. Skin-Deep (arXiv 2606.22676) reads activations of a single aligned model and produces one scalar
  predicting how much refusal survives a future fine-tune, over 21 models, as a contrastive principal-component
  statistic relative to the standard refusal direction. Both are re-implemented and forged alongside our own,
  with their prompt-set and layer-grouping sensitivity measured since those are not fully pinned down in the
  source text. The J-space protocol of arXiv 2607.12792 separates dangerous from safe prompts in a single model's
  pre-generation activation space; if it cannot be reproduced faithfully it is classified from functional form
  and that is stated. All are levels read at fixed coordinates, so the edit-rank law predicts their rung before
  we measure it, none has been subjected to an edited checkpoint, and none is validated against a target a
  blanket refuser loses on.
- |-
  arXiv 2606.16349, on harmfulness-refusal coupling under dynamic adversarial fine-tuning, is the nearest
  relative of our coupling readout and its own conclusion is adverse, so we adopt it rather than argue with it:
  it reports supervised fine-tuning as a negative control whose coupling barely moves while attack success stays
  high, and concludes coupling is a descriptive diagnostic rather than a standalone safety predictor. Our claim is
  not that coupling predicts safety better; it is that across-item statistics of this form are the ones a
  constant-offset forgery cannot move and the ones that survive a held-out lineage, which are properties of
  functional form and were never that paper's question. arXiv 2607.00572 (HARC) is complementary in the other
  direction, TRAINING such a coupling in as a defence where we only read it. The wider family - arXiv 2507.11878
  on harmfulness and refusal being encoded separately, arXiv 2603.05773 on recognition versus execution, and arXiv
  2609.14759, which finds that as the basis widens moral judgment keeps reading more of it while refusal levels
  off at a single harm direction - has established the phenomenon at the item level. The honest statement of the
  gap is narrow: the per-checkpoint number exists, the axes it should be judged on do not.
- |-
  arXiv 2608.09624, 'Measuring the Wrong Thing', reports harmful-intent decoding AUROC falling from 0.936 plain
  to 0.803 under wrapping, and arXiv 2607.13075, 'The Entanglement Wall', reports fixed-probe transfer of only
  0.656 to 0.819 to matched pairs across three model families. Together with Tan et al. (arXiv 2406.09289) on the
  out-of-distribution brittleness of steering vectors, these are why the iteration-1 claim that a perturbation
  closes the rank-one forgery route was withdrawn: 0.803 is a usable direction, and an adversary who knows the
  metric's definition refits on the metric's own distribution at identical cost. The perturbation arm survives as
  a measurement run in Stage 0, and the rank-one rung is closed by the weight instrument instead. All score
  PROMPTS with a fixed model; none produces a per-checkpoint number.
- |-
  arXiv 2406.05946, 'Safety Alignment Should Be Made More Than Just a Few Tokens Deep', established that
  alignment is often shallow and that deepening it is a training objective. It diagnoses shallowness WITH training
  access and then fixes it. We ask the question it leaves untouched: can shallowness be read off a single
  downloaded checkpoint with no reference and no training access, and does that reading predict how much safety
  survives a shift. arXiv 2412.09565, 'Obfuscated Activations Bypass LLM Latent-Space Defenses', is the closest
  work on gaming an internal readout and reports an obfuscation tax, but its object is a per-input monitor at
  inference time defended by a probe the attacker can query, and its direction is making a harmful input look
  benign; ours is a model-level certificate computed by a downloader who never meets the uploader, making an
  unsafe MODEL look safe through levers a monitor-evasion attacker does not have, starting with the repository's
  own configuration files.
- |-
  arXiv 2602.04653, on inference-time backdoors via chat templates, with its static scan of roughly 192,000 Hub
  chat templates, establishes that the files shipping beside the weights are an unexamined and widely exploitable
  surface. It points that lever at making models behave badly; we point the identical zero-cost lever at making
  models SCORE well. Because a content scan of the shipped template is reference-free, our rung zero is metric
  hygiene rather than a threat, so it is reported and then removed from the headline, which starts one rung up.
  arXiv 2505.17815 and arXiv 2509.18058 establish that evaluations can be defeated from the inside by a model that
  infers it is being tested; they locate the agency in the MODEL, we locate it in the PUBLISHER and in files the
  model never sees as input, and the two failure modes call for opposite defences.
- |-
  Efficient-benchmarking work using item response theory is the one place the two sides of safety are combined.
  arXiv 2608.05086, 'Item Response Theory for AI Safety', makes the adaptive-item claim that roughly ten adaptively
  chosen items suffice for several individual benchmarks, cutting evaluation cost by 97 to 99 percent; arXiv
  2606.20626 reports a reduction of at least 80 percent. That line points harmful-refusal and over-refusal the same
  way by sign-flipping the over-refusal benchmark, but it is fully behavioural, needs the benchmark items, and
  yields a ranking factor rather than an operating point. No cheap metric read from weights or activations has been
  validated against a target a model refusing everything loses on.
- |-
  arXiv 2502.16173, 'Mapping 1,000+ Language Models via the Log-Likelihood Vector' (ACL 2025), is the closest
  precedent for the manifold limb: it gives every model coordinates whose squared Euclidean distance approximates
  the divergence between generation distributions, and builds a map over more than a thousand models, which is the
  scale our honest-manifold fit needs and the evidence such a fit is affordable. Those coordinates are black-box
  and about similarity and lineage rather than safety, and nothing there asks whether a checkpoint sits off the
  manifold because someone edited it. We adopt it as precedent AND as a baseline: if a log-likelihood model map
  detects our forgeries as well as a metric-vector manifold does, the internal coordinates have not earned their
  forward passes, and we report that.
- |-
  The secret-draw protocol is deliberately NOT claimed as novel and the literature is cited so it cannot be
  mistaken for a claim. Private and dynamic benchmarking - Dynabench (arXiv 2104.14337), Shirali, Abebe and Hardt's
  'A Theory of Dynamic Benchmarks' (arXiv 2210.03165), which proves iterated benchmark-versus-model fitting stalls
  after about three rounds, and TRUCE private benchmarking (arXiv 2403.00393) - all do the same thing for the same
  reason, for black-box behavioural items. Strategic classification (arXiv 1506.06980) supplies the
  cost-of-manipulation vocabulary but assumes the scoring rule is public and fixed, where our hidden randomness is
  the item draw rather than the rule. Casper, Ezell, Siegmann et al., 'Black-Box Access is Insufficient for Rigorous
  AI Audits' (FAccT 2024, arXiv 2401.14446), is the policy argument that audits must look inside the model, which
  our weight-and-activation instantiation is a concrete instance of. What none combines is a metric read from
  weights or activations, an adversary who knows the metric's definition but not the audit-time draw, and a
  perturbation-family pool as the source of that secrecy.
inspiration: |-
  The frame came from anti-doping laboratories, and so did both repairs. An athlete can raise a testosterone
  LEVEL, and for years the test was that level, so the test was beaten. What replaced it was the carbon isotope
  ratio: synthetic testosterone carries a different carbon-13 signature, so the fraud is caught not by the size of
  any one number but by an inconsistency between numbers that a real body cannot produce apart. The same principle
  runs through forensic accounting, where fabricated books satisfy the headline total but violate the joint
  distribution of leading digits, and through art authentication, where the pigment is right and the pigment's trace
  elements are wrong. Safety metrics for downloaded models are currently all levels, and nobody has asked what their
  ratios do.

  Anti-doping also did not defeat targeted evasion by inventing an un-spikeable analyte. It used OUT-OF-COMPETITION
  RANDOM TESTING, so the athlete cannot know when or what is measured, and the ATHLETE BIOLOGICAL PASSPORT, which
  catches the intervention by the trace it leaves rather than by the value it produces. Both transfer: the audit's
  items are drawn at audit time rather than published, and the rank-one edit is closed by the trace it writes into
  every layer it touches.

  This iteration's repair came from a fourth field, and from taking a critique seriously rather than defending
  against it. The previous instrument measured the SIZE of a spectral anomaly, and sizes are exactly what differs
  between one trained network and another, so the honest baseline moved more than the signal did. Chemometrics and
  signal processing solved that problem long ago by throwing the magnitudes away and keeping only the SUBSPACE - the
  principal angles between what two measurements span, which is what a Grassmannian distance is for. A projector
  knows which directions a matrix uses and nothing about how strongly. That single change makes the statistic
  invariant to every layer's own spectrum, and it converts the reviewer's kill shot into a measurement: a per-layer
  abliteration tool is not drawing random directions, it is estimating the same refusal feature at every layer, so
  the alignment it leaves is a number to be measured rather than an assumption to be defended.

  Two further imports shaped the design. From economics, costly signalling: a signal is informative only when it is
  expensive to produce for those lacking the underlying quality, which converts "is this metric valid" into the
  measurable "what does forging it cost". From clinical-trial statistics, the habit of asking whether a candidate
  marker merely reports the outcome you can already see or predicts one you cannot - here the difference between
  predicting a benchmark score, which a plain refusal rate already does, and predicting whether that score survives a
  lineage or a condition the benchmark did not contain.

  The last piece is internal: the field's own repeated negative result, that a plain refusal rate and even the model
  card beat every internal readout. That is a strange result to accept at face value, and the resolution offered here
  is that behaviour will always win at predicting behaviour on honest models, so the comparison has to be run where
  behaviour is not a reliable witness - on a lineage nobody tuned on, and on a checkpoint someone had a reason to
  shape.
terms:
- term: Cheap safety metric
  definition: >-
    A number estimating how safe a model is, computed from a single checkpoint in seconds to a couple of minutes from its
    weights, a few dozen short forward passes, or a handful of generations, with no parent model, no attested base to diff
    against, and no benchmark run.
- term: Level metric
  definition: >-
    A norm, rate, mean projection or unconditional propensity read at a fixed direction, layer and token position - a functional
    of the model evaluated without reference to how it varies across inputs. Predicted to be the constant-forgeable class
    and the class that fails on held-out lineages. A zero-prompt metric has no item axis, so it is a level by construction,
    which is why the floor on a trustworthy metric is not zero prompts.
- term: Across-item metric
  definition: >-
    A correlation, rank ordering or area under a curve computed over the item set, and therefore invariant to a constant offset
    - exactly so for a linear read at the injection layer, and approximately for anything read through a normalisation, where
    the pre-registered tolerance is 0.05 correlation units.
- term: Forgery cost
  definition: >-
    The cheapest rung of a fixed cost-ordered ladder of checkpoint edits that pushes a metric past a threshold set at a stated
    false-positive rate on a large honest panel, while the model's two-sided safety does not improve by more than a powered
    margin. Recorded in wall-clock seconds, training FLOPs and labelled examples, and reported as a curve over false-positive
    rates.
- term: Detection cost, Tier A and Tier B
  definition: >-
    What it costs an auditor to notice a rung was applied. TIER A is reference-free and uses only the downloaded repository
    with no knowledge of its family: content checks on the chat template and generation config, a state-dict key-and-shape
    check against the architecture named in config.json, and the zero-prompt weight statistic. TIER B additionally diffs those
    files against the family default, which presumes an attested reference. Tier A is the headline because it is the access
    model the request specifies; the gap between the tiers measures how much detection power comes from knowing the family.
- term: Undetectable forgery cost
  definition: >-
    The headline quantity: the cheapest rung that both pushes the metric into the safe region and survives the Tier A reference-free
    screen. It can be far higher than plain forgery cost for exactly the rungs that leave a structural trace, and if it turns
    out to be constant across the battery that is itself the result - the only undetectable forgery is training.
- term: Forgery ladder
  definition: >-
    Six rungs. F0, an edit to files shipping in the repository. F1, an inference-time system prompt. F2a, the CONSTANT rung.
    F2b, the RANK-ONE rung. F3, a small keyword-triggered refusal adapter trained for about a hundred steps. F4, genuine light
    safety fine-tuning on real paired data, which buys real safety and caps the ladder.
- term: Constant rung, F2a
  definition: >-
    An item-independent additive offset to a band of residual writes. As a change to the linear map this is rank zero, and
    the identical offset lands on every item so it cancels exactly from any across-item statistic read linearly at the injection
    layer. How it is BUILT matters for detection: most panel architectures define no bias on the attention output or MLP down
    projections, so an explicit bias tensor is caught for free by a key-and-shape check, and the offset is therefore realised
    instead on a near-constant carrier coordinate such as an attention-sink or massive-activation dimension, with its across-item
    constancy verified against the 0.05 tolerance.
- term: Rank-one rung, F2b
  definition: >-
    The residual write becomes W x plus alpha r (d transpose x), which is item-dependent because each item is scaled by its
    own component along d. This is genuinely rank one in the map, it CAN move across-item statistics, and it is a published
    method rather than a trick invented here. It writes one shared direction into every write matrix it touches.
- term: Abliteration
  definition: >-
    A training-free community edit that suppresses a refusal direction in the weights, replacing W by (I minus kappa r r transpose)
    W, producing an uncensored checkpoint. At kappa equal to one it is a projection, so it is singular and has no inverse.
    Because it removes each item's own component along r it is ITEM-DEPENDENT and belongs in the rank-one class, so its filed
    prediction is not invariance but a FALL in across-item coupling. Real recipes vary in three ways that matter to any weight
    detector: whether one direction is shared across layers or fitted per layer, whether kappa is one or less, and whether
    all layers or a band are edited.
- term: Subspace alignment (the shared-direction scar)
  definition: >-
    The zero-prompt, parent-free weight statistic that forms the detection column - ADOPTED FROM PRIOR ART, not introduced
    here: a publicly released community model scanner already computes it, and we cite it rather than claim it. For each residual-write
    matrix, form the projector onto its bottom-k (or top-k) LEFT singular subspace; average those projectors over a contiguous
    band of layers; take the largest eigenvalue. Bottom-subspace alignment reads abliteration, top-subspace alignment reads
    injection. Because a projector discards singular values, the statistic is invariant to each layer's own spectrum - measured
    at 0.168 on a Gaussian honest stack and 0.177 on a heavy-tailed one, where the raw Gram statistic it replaces swung from
    0.821 to 0.119. Because it is windowed, an edit confined to part of the stack is found rather than diluted - 1.000 at
    a half-stack band where the raw Gram sat inside honest range. Because it is a continuous overlap it degrades gracefully,
    reading 0.953 at ablation weight 0.7 and tracking the cross-layer cosine monotonically down to 0.358 at a cosine of 0.25.
    It reads an EDIT rather than a RISK and is never reported as a safety score. What this study adds to it is not the formula
    but the things it has never been given: a null model and an honest-panel false-positive rate, held-out-family validation,
    bf16-as-shipped thresholds, a census bounding which real recipes it can see, and an injection arm.
- term: Local rank deficiency
  definition: >-
    The companion statistic that needs no sharing at all: per matrix, the ratio of the smallest to the second-smallest singular
    value. A full-strength projection makes the matrix exactly rank-deficient and collapses this ratio, whatever direction
    each layer used and whatever that layer's spectrum looks like, so it catches per-layer abliteration which subspace alignment
    is blind to by construction. Pre-registered in log units against a bf16-rounded reference, because real abliterated checkpoints
    ship in bf16 and never show an exact algebraic zero.
- term: Cross-layer cosine
  definition: >-
    The mean pairwise absolute cosine between the per-layer suppressed directions of an edited checkpoint, recovered parent-free
    as each layer's bottom left singular vector. It is the variable subspace alignment is graded in, it distinguishes a genuinely
    shared-direction recipe from a per-layer one, and it is MEASURED on real abliterated checkpoints in the Stage 0 recipe
    census rather than assumed.
- term: Recipe census
  definition: >-
    The Stage 0 survey of 30 to 50 real abliterated Hub checkpoints, classified by tool and recipe from the card and by realised
    strength, layer coverage and cross-layer cosine from the weights. It reports the fraction of real abliterations that are
    full-strength single-direction all-layer, which is the fraction the previous version's statistic could see, and it is
    run before the ladder is graded so the detector's coverage is a pre-committed number rather than a discovery.
- term: Cross-fitted internal harm estimate
  definition: >-
    A harm direction fitted on held-out folds of items and evaluated only on items that did not fit it, with a pre-registered
    fold structure stratified by harm category. Cross-fitting is part of the definition, not an analysis choice, because an
    in-sample difference-in-means projection at a residual width of two to three thousand and a few dozen items separates
    pure noise at AUROC 1.000.
- term: Secret-draw coupling
  definition: >-
    The shipped discriminator: over a few dozen items drawn AT AUDIT TIME from a large pool of presentation conditions rather
    than from a published set, the share of across-item variation in the model's refusal drive at the first generated token
    explained by its own cross-fitted internal harm estimate. Drawing at audit time means a publisher can fit an edit to the
    metric's form but not to its draw.
- term: Decision spread
  definition: >-
    The across-item standard deviation of the refusal drive, in logits. It is the denominator of the coupling ratio and goes
    to zero for both a blanket refuser and a never-refuser, which is what stops the ratio being a quotient of two noise terms
    and what makes a model that refuses everything lose.
- term: Exchange rate
  definition: >-
    The continuous form of undetectable forgery cost, now defined for every rung rather than only the weight ones. Sweep the
    rung's magnitude - edit strength for the weight rungs, a graded preamble token budget for the text rungs - and take the
    Tier A screen's z-score against the honest panel at the smallest setting that pushes the metric past its threshold. It
    separates metrics that share a rung label but differ by orders of magnitude in how loud the change that breaks them has
    to be.
- term: Two-sided discrimination ground truth
  definition: >-
    The safety label the metrics are graded against: graded compliance with harmful requests combined with false refusal of
    benign requests that merely look alarming, constructed so a model refusing everything scores badly rather than perfectly,
    and reported beside a named capability column. It is not our invention - the better model cards already pair a safety
    rate with a refusal rate, and at least one public multi-model safety evaluation ships an over-refusal scenario beside
    its harm scenarios.
- term: Retention ratio
  definition: >-
    A checkpoint's out-of-distribution safety divided by its in-distribution safety, on the same harmful items presented plainly
    versus wrapped, paraphrased or translated. The quantity a downloader actually cares about, and the one a few-prompt behavioural
    score cannot estimate without running the out-of-distribution set.
- term: Off-manifold residual
  definition: >-
    The distance of a checkpoint's metric vector from the low-dimensional set that honest checkpoints occupy, fitted on at
    least 120 honest Hub checkpoints with family-centring over a pre-registered handful of coordinates, never on the ground-truth
    panel. A consistency check among readouts rather than the level of any one of them; if it degenerates into a family detector,
    that is reported as the result.
summary: |-
  Cheap safety metrics for downloaded models are chosen by correlating them with benchmark scores on honest
  checkpoints, which answers the wrong question twice: it never checks whether they survive a lineage they were not
  tuned on, and it assumes the uploader is honest. We answer both. First, across 50 registered single-checkpoint
  metrics we predict and test that only ACROSS-ITEM readouts - how refusal varies with the item - separate
  safety-tuned from instruct from abliterated on held-out lineages, because published work shows harm knowledge
  itself is near-identical across all three. Second, we rank the metrics by what an UNDETECTABLE fake costs, since
  cheap to apply and cheap to catch is not a threat, with an algebraic reason for the ordering: constants cancel from
  across-item statistics, while a rank-one edit moves them but writes one shared direction into every layer it
  touches, which an existing public parent-free weight scanner already sees. That scanner is prior art, not our
  contribution, and we say so; our contribution is the cost-and-detection axis it is used on, plus the calibration,
  held-out validation and recipe census it has never been given.
alternates:
- title: Internals buy fewer prompts, not better answers
  hypothesis: >-
    At a matched prompt budget, an activation readout is a lower-variance estimator of the SAME safety quantity a black-box
    score estimates, so internals win only in the few-prompt regime and the advantage vanishes as the budget grows. Concretely:
    with at most eight prompts the best cross-fitted activation readout predicts the full two-sided discrimination score better
    than any behavioural estimator built from the same eight prompts, and the two curves cross by roughly sixty-four prompts.
    No forgeries, no ladder - just the crossover curve, with the crossover point itself as the deliverable number.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if the real reason internal readouts have never beaten black-box baselines is that every published comparison
    gave the baseline an unlimited prompt budget. The world would have to be one where refusal is essentially one-dimensional
    and behaviourally visible, so no unique construct lives inside the model, but where binary generation outcomes are noisy
    enough that a graded continuous read of the same decision is worth many samples. That makes cheapness rather than validity
    the thing internals buy, which is cleaner and more immediately actionable than the main hypothesis if no metric turns
    out to be forgery-resistant at all.
- title: Refusal depth predicts what survives a shift
  hypothesis: >-
    Drop the forgeries entirely and read one ordering off a single checkpoint: the layer at which its refusal signal first
    becomes decodable, relative to the layer at which the request's semantic content first becomes decodable, both cross-fitted
    with a per-model permutation null. Claim: refusal that resolves EARLIER than the content it is supposedly about is a lookup
    on surface features, and the earlier that crossing, the smaller the fraction of the model's in-distribution safety that
    survives wrapping, paraphrase or translation. One layer sweep, no edits, no manifold, no constructed fakes.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if real Hub checkpoints already span the whole shallow-to-deep range, which is plausible given how many are
    light fine-tunes and merges - in which case constructing forgeries is expensive apparatus for variance that already exists
    in the wild. It beats the main hypothesis in a world where deliberate metric-gaming is rare but accidental shallow alignment
    is everywhere, and it disagrees concretely: under this alternate the useful signal is an ordering of two layer indices,
    not a relationship across items, so the two predict different metrics to be the best one.
- title: The recipe is the signal, not the safety
  hypothesis: >-
    For a checkpoint you know nothing about, the only cheap thing that reliably survives held-out families is a read of its
    EDIT HISTORY from the weights, and no activation-based safety readout adds anything on top of it. Existing parent-free
    weight scanners answer only a yes-or-no question, was this abliterated. The claim here is that the same weights answer
    a strictly richer one, and that the richer answer is what carries the safety signal: recover, parent-free and in seconds,
    WHICH RECIPE was used - shared versus per-layer direction, realised ablation strength, which layer band - and that recovered
    recipe, in particular the realised strength, is MONOTONE in the checkpoint's measured harmful compliance and predicts
    its two-sided safety better than any cross-fitted activation metric in the battery once whole families are held out. That
    would turn a binary tamper flag into a graded safety read, which no existing scanner provides. The honest deliverable
    is a recipe-resolved detector with a stated scope, and the paper's job is to map exactly which risks it is blind to, starting
    with a model that was never edited and is simply unsafe.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if what actually varies across Hub checkpoints is edit history rather than safety, which near-zero within-family
    safety variance plus the published finding that harm geometry is nearly identical in base, instruct and abliterated variants
    both point to. It beats the main hypothesis in a world where coupling turns out flat or noisy at a few dozen items, and
    it disagrees head-on: under this alternate the detection column is not a supporting axis for a safety metric, it is the
    entire result, and it makes a sharper prediction the main hypothesis does not - that ablation STRENGTH, recovered from
    the weights alone, is monotone in measured harmful compliance.
- title: A learned metamodel reads lineage, not safety
  hypothesis: >-
    A small regressor trained on pooled hidden states predicts benchmark safety scores better than any hand-written formula,
    and the reason is that it recovers architecture and lineage identity rather than safety. The ablation predicts the advantage
    collapses to nothing once whole families are held out, while a lineage-identity probe on the same features stays near
    perfect - and the gap between those two curves is the deliverable, because it puts a number on how much of any activation-based
    safety score is family bookkeeping.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins as the right answer if the strongest rival to every formula is a learned metamodel and nobody has isolated what
    it reads. It beats the main hypothesis in a world where the metamodel genuinely does generalise to unseen families, which
    would mean a safety signal exists in activations that no hand-designed statistic has captured, and the main hypothesis's
    whole framing - interpretable named metrics ranked by forgeability - would be looking in the wrong place.

id: dataset_iter1_dir2
type: dataset
objective: >-
  Build the two registries the screen cannot run without, and settle by COUNTING the two population questions that previous
  iterations asserted and the reviewer overturned: how many independent safety-tuned LINEAGES actually exist, and how many
  external checkpoints genuinely carry a published two-sided safety number. Both were over-counted by roughly an order of
  magnitude and both set the power of the headline claim, so they are measured here, before any metric is designed, rather
  than discovered at analysis time.
approach: |-
  REGISTRY A, THE CHECKPOINT PANEL, one row per checkpoint with a verified label. Columns: repo id, parameter count, architecture, safetensors byte size, gated status re-checked with an AUTHENTICATED request (a previous census recorded hard 401s for huihui-ai Qwen3 checkpoints that are in fact gated:auto and recoverable, and that error removed the best-known abliterated anchor for no reason), chat-template hash, class label in {base, ordinary-instruct, safety-tuned, abliterated}, LINEAGE id, and a held-out fold id. Four strata. (i) The anchor lineage the request names: Qwen3-4B-Base, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-4B-SafeRL and an abliterated Qwen3-4B - all four verified live and ungated, with DreamFast/qwen3-4b-heretic as the open abliterated member and the gated huihui checkpoint added if auto-approval succeeds. Instruct, SafeRL and abliterated share a chat template and are one comparison stratum; base uses a different format and is kept separate with a plain renderer. (ii) The abliterated arm, extending the existing 37-checkpoint card census, carrying its recipe fields (stated direction scope, stated layer band, stated strength) and an explicit UNSTATED marker, since 56.8 percent state no recipe and that is precisely the population the weight read has to resolve. (iii) THE SAFETY-TUNED ARM, WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN CENSUSED AND IS THE SCARCE ARM THAT SETS THE POWER OF A THREE-WAY CLAIM. A naive Hub query over {SafeRLHF, safe-rl, safety-tuned, safety aligned, safety finetuned, harmless dpo} returns on the order of 339 repos, but five uploaders account for about 90 percent of them and one uploader alone is dozens of epoch checkpoints of four algorithms on a SINGLE parent. The resampling unit is therefore (parent x tuning run), not the repo; collapse epoch, step and timestamp suffixes; publish the independent-lineage count; and flag whether each row is an official safety RL release or an academic PKU-SafeRLHF re-run, because mixing those is hidden heterogeneity inside the class we are trying to separate. (iv) The honest panel for thresholds and the manifold, with an EXPLICIT INCLUSION RULE rather than 'random instruct checkpoints': uploader is the model's originating organisation, and no abliterated / uncensored / heretic / decensored token appears in the id, tags, card or declared lineage. The panel size is reported as a FUNCTION OF MEASURED DOWNLOAD THROUGHPUT on a first slice of five checkpoints, not declared as a floor, because a floor that cannot be funded is not a floor; weight-only coordinates need the large N and activation coordinates do not, so the panel is explicitly split into a large weight-only tier and a stratified activation subsample with both n values carried in the registry.
  REGISTRY B, THE EXTERNAL GROUND TRUTH, joined per checkpoint and RECOUNTED from the files rather than from abstracts. The HELM safety suite ships 435 runs = 87 models x 5 scenarios and every model has an xstest row, which is a PUBLISHED two-sided ground truth and removes any suggestion that a two-sided target is our invention. But the open-weight subset is far smaller than the headline count: remove API-only organisations, then closed-weight entries, then the roughly nineteen 32B-to-1T models that cannot be transferred at all, then the -with-guardian pairs that are the same weights plus an external guard, then the fp8 turbo servings whose published score does not correspond to the bf16 Hub weights we would read. Publish the surviving id list with a parameter count and a SERVED-PRECISION column and let the number be what it is; the honest figure is on the order of eight at or below 8B and eleven or twelve stretching to 32B. Pool the companion risk-taxonomy suite NOT for n - it shares 75 of 87 models and its extras are almost all API-only - but for a SECOND INDEPENDENT OUTCOME COLUMN on the shared models, which is what lets the study ask whether a metric tracking refusal-style safety also tracks a risk taxonomy, and which is the request's own instruction that safety is not only refusal. Add the third suite's downloadable table the same way, and take capability from the archived open-leaderboard result files, which are abundant at every size, rather than by re-running a harness. The sub-4B scarcity is not an obstacle to be worked around but a SCORED FINDING to be stated in one line: the models a downloader is most likely to meet are exactly the ones with no published safety number.
  REGISTRY C, THE ITEM BATTERY, fixed now so no metric can be tuned on its own evaluation items. Graded-harm items from StrongREJECT and the JailbreakBench behaviours, which ship 100 harmful and 100 benign as a matched pair; benign-but-alarming twins from XSTest, joined on the `focus` field, which is the real twin key and which a widely used mirror of XSTest LACKS, plus the hard over-refusal subset of OR-Bench; contentless and graded-preamble passes; and a presentation-condition pool for audit-time sampling taken from a benchmark shipping several hundred base prompts each in about twenty linguistic mutations. Every item carries a harm-category label for stratified cross-fitting folds and a fold id assigned by hash BEFORE collection, so the held-out reserve is sealed rather than chosen.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

qwen3 on huggingface has base model also official safety finetuned version and there is a community finetuned uncensored model called abliterated. take these models and do a mech interp analysis of how they differ in activation. also find some patterns in internal computation on safety prompts. and possibly create a new metric for safety. so that for any random model on huggingface you would not need to run the full benchmarks, but only this metric on 0- to few prompts and get a safety evaluation

i want cheap safety metrics that work on a single model. no parent, no reference model, no
attested base to diff against - assume i found some random model on huggingface and i have
nothing else. reads weights or activations. generation allowed but minimal, a few prompts at
most. seconds to a couple of minutes per model, not a benchmark run.

step 1 - explore. take one lineage: Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base, Qwen/Qwen3-4B, Qwen/Qwen3-4B-SafeRL (the
official safety RL model, not the instruct one), and an abliterated Qwen3-4B. instruct, saferl
and abliterated share a chat template so they are directly comparable, base uses a different
format so keep it separate. poke around open ended, look at weights and activations, see what
actually differs between the four.

step 2 - design 50 metrics. informed by what you found in step 1, but also by the literature -
safety papers and mech interp papers in general, not only safety ones. include a few black-box
metrics too, things that only read logits or output text, like the logit-gap margin, so we have
a comparison point for whether looking inside the model actually buys anything.

step 3 - test all 50 much wider. other lineages, pairs and triplets where a safety-tuned or
abliterated sibling exists, and standalone models where none does. for each metric: does it
separate safe vs normal vs abliterated. hold out a set of models that no metric is tuned on,
because picking the best of 50 on the models you designed them on is cheating.

step 4 - ground truth. pull real benchmark numbers from official sources, model cards, papers,
leaderboards, not just your own judge. safety is not only refusal - try to cover other aspects
too, see TrustLLM and AIR-Bench for what that means. if that turns out to be too much, then two
separate refusal rates is acceptable as a fallback: refusal on harmful prompts, and refusal on
harmless prompts that only look dangerous (xstest style). either way a model that refuses
everything must lose, not win. also pull capability benchmarks, gsm8k, mmlu, arena-hard, to
see whether safety trades off against performance. do not use Qwen3Guard as a judge for SafeRL,
it was SafeRL's training reward.

step 5 - take the 10 best metrics and correlation-test them against those benchmark numbers.
report the resampling unit and both aggregation units. a metric that only works within one
architecture family is a negative result, say so.

bonus - if a metric works really well, mech interp analysis of why. what is it reading, which
layers and components carry it, what breaks it.

bonus bonus - instead of a static formula, train a small metamodel on activations that predicts
the safety benchmark scores. if it beats the formulas, explain what in the model's internal
computation it is picking up, and why that signal exists.

hardware: each experiment runs on a worker with one 16 GB VRAM GPU. load the 4B models in bf16 with transformers so hidden states and weights are readable. do not switch to llama.cpp or GGUF, that hides the activations this study is about.


invariant: at least 3 of the metrics you ship must read hidden states or weights of a single model. logit-only and teacher-forced readouts are baselines, at most 2 of them.

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

```
You are verifying HuggingFace Hub repo availability for a data-collection plan. Use the aii-web-tools skill to fetch HF API endpoints as JSON (e.g. https://huggingface.co/api/models/<repo_id>). Do NOT download weights. Do NOT write files.

For each repo below report: exists (200/404), `gated` value (false / "auto" / "manual"), `safetensors.total` param count, `safetensors.parameters` dtype breakdown, `cardData.license`, downloads, and whether safetensors files are present.

ANCHOR LINEAGE:
- Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base
- Qwen/Qwen3-4B
- Qwen/Qwen3-4B-SafeRL
- DreamFast/qwen3-4b-heretic
- huihui-ai/Qwen3-4B-abliterated
- huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-4B-abliterated-v2
- mlabonne/Qwen3-4B-abliterated

SAFETY-TUNED ARM CANDIDATES (this arm has never been censused; we need to know how many INDEPENDENT (parent x tuning-run) lineages exist, not repo count):
Run these HF search API queries and report, for each, the total count and the top-20 repo ids with their `author`:
- https://huggingface.co/api/models?search=SafeRLHF&filter=text-generation&limit=100&full=false
- https://huggingface.co/api/models?search=safety-tuned&filter=text-generation&limit=100
- https://huggingface.co/api/models?search=safety%20aligned&filter=text-generation&limit=100
- https://huggingface.co/api/models?search=harmless%20dpo&filter=text-generation&limit=100
Then answer ONE question concretely: after collapsing `-epoch-N`, `-step-N`, `-ckpt-N` and timestamp suffixes and grouping by (author, declared base_model), roughly how many DISTINCT (parent x tuning run) safety-tuned lineages appear, and which 5 authors dominate? Give the arithmetic.

Also check whether these exist and are ungated (they are candidate REAL blanket-refuser / over-refusal anchors):
- any huihui-ai repo with "CensorTune" in the name (search https://huggingface.co/api/models?author=huihui-ai&search=CensorTune)

Report compactly: one markdown table for the named repos, one short section for the search counts + the lineage arithmetic, one "surprises" list. Max 600 words.

```
Run exactly this and report the output verbatim, nothing else:

python3 -c "
import json
p='/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_fcYd_7ruOwtm/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_dataset_1/.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json'
d=json.load(open(p))
print('PARSE OK')
print('keys:', sorted(d.keys()))
for k,v in d.items():
    print(k, type(v).__name__, len(v) if isinstance(v,str) else v)
"

If it raises, report the FULL traceback including the exact character offset and print the 200 characters of the file surrounding that offset. Do not edit the file. Do not fix anything.
```
